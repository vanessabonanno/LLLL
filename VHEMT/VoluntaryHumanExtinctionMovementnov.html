					<p><span class="mention person" about="Gwynn Mackellen" data-sort="Gwynn Mackellen" data-label="Gwynn Mackellen"> Gwynn Mackellen</span> was 26 when she decided to get sterilised. It took the recycling consultant, who is based in <span class="mention place" about="California" data-sort="California" data-label="California">California</span> five years to find an appropriate doctor under the public health plan she was on, but she was determined. In 2012, she succeeded. “I always knew I didn’t want kids, for <span class="key" about="environmental issues">environmental reasons</span>,” she says.</p>

					<p>“I work in the waste industry, and our waste is the downstream of people. It’s not people being bad; it’s just the effects of people.” Just as it’s not only bad people <span class="key" about="environmental issues">deforesting</span>, she says: “The trees are being cut down on our behalf. <span class="key" about="environmental issues">Plastic waste</span> is being dumped and minerals are being mined not because of bad people, but because of people. Having fewer of us, there will be less of those effects.”</p>

					<p><span class="mention person" about="Gwynn Mackellen" data-sort="Gwynn Mackellen" data-label="Gwynn Mackellen">Mackellen</span> identifies as an <span class="key" about="anti-natalism">antinatalist</span>, a philosophical movement based around the tenet that it’s cruel to bring sentient lives, doomed to suffering and to causing suffering, into the world. “Or at least I think our culture is very <span class="key" about="pro-natalism">pro-natalist</span> and it’s to our detriment. I would like to see us <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">voluntarily reduce our population</span>.” But cultural pressures, she says, drive people to <span class="key" about="procreation">have children</span> by celebrating <span class="key" about="procreation">childbearing</span> without acknowledging the consequences for themselves and the planet.</p>

					<p>“My mum grew up thinking that getting married and <span class="key" about="procreation">having kids</span> was what you did, but she raised my sister and me to not feel like those were our only options.” Her stance has posed no problems to her partner of 10 years, and many of those around her were congratulatory when she was sterilised. “I live in the liberal <span class="mention place" about="San Francisco" data-sort="San Francisco" data-label="San Francisco">[San Francisco] Bay area</span>,” she says, “and I’ve always been really vocal about this.” However, she can’t always discuss her concerns about <span class="key" about="overpopulation">human population</span> with friends, which is why she is part of a community called the <span class="mention org" about="VHEMT" data-sort="VHEMT" data-label="VHEMT">Voluntary Human Extinction Movement</span>, or VHEMT (pronounced vehement) for short. Despite the drastic-sounding title, the organisation welcomes those whose end goal isn’t necessarily <span class="key" about="human extinction">human extinction</span>, along with parents who have come around to the <a href="https://www.vhemt.org"><span class="mention org" about="VHEMT" data-sort="VHEMT" data-label="VHEMT">VHEMT</span></a>perspective to some degree. The organisation’s literature is rational and often humorous in tone and, says <span class= "mention person" about="Gwynn Mackellen" data-sort="Gwynn Mackellen" data-label="Gwynn Mackellen">Mackellen</span>: “It’s nice to talk openly with people who have similar feelings and frustrations, like when I read the <span class="key" about="environmental issues">environmental news</span> and think: wow, how could anybody produce a new human when the effects of humans are very obvious, I feel, and the situation is getting worse.</p>

					<p>The UK-based organisation <a href="https://www.populationmatters.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjw06LZBRBNEiwA2vgMVUJpAqts9A5_RcN_D46na7I3zzvvCzLO8zxZO1umGIihonV4YVqgQRoCzEcQAvD_BwE"><span class="mention org" about="Population Matters" data-sort="Population Matters" data-label="Population Matters">Population Matters</span></a> wouldn’t call for <span class="key" about="human extinction">human extinction</span>– even in jest – but it does campaign against <span class="key" about="overpopulation">population growth</span> which, it says, contributes to <span class="key" about="environmental issues">environmental degradation</span>, <span class="key" about="environmental issues">resource depletion</span>, poverty and inequality. To its list of influential patrons, which already includes <span class="mention person" about="David Attenborough" data-sort="David Attenborough" data-label="David Attenborough"> David Attenborough</span>, <span class="mention person" about="Chris Packham" data-sort="Chris Packham" data-label="Chris Packham">Chris Packham</span>, <span class="mention person" about="Lionel Shriver" data-sort="Lionel Shriver" data-label="Lionel Shriver">Lionel Shriver</span> and the primatologist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/14/primatologist-jane-goodall-tarzan-married-the-wrong-jane"><span class="mention person" about="Jane Goodall" data-sort="Jane Goodall" data-label="Jane Goodall">Jane Goodall</span></a>, it has recently added the racing driver and environmental activist<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/apr/08/nascar-female-driver-leilani-munter-racing-extinction-vegan-environment"><span class="mention person" about="Leilani Münter" data-sort="Leilani Münter" data-label="Leilani Münter"> Leilani Münter</span></a>.

					<p>When people ask her if she has children,<span class="mention person" about="Leilani Münter" data_sort="Leilani Münter" data-label="Leilani Münter">Münter</span>, who is 44, has a prepared answer: “No, my husband and I are <span class="key" about="child-free">child-free</span> by <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">choice</span>.” Saying <span class="key" about="child-free">child-free</span>, she argues, doesn’t imply you are deprived, as the more standard “childless” might. And by letting them know it isn’t a sad topic to be avoided, she says, “it opens up the door for them to ask: ‘Oh, that’s interesting, why did you choose not to?’” <span class="mention person" aboit="Leilani Münter" data-sort="Leilani Münter" data-label="Leilani Münter">Münter</span> wants to move the awkward topic of <span class="key" about="overpopulation">overpopulation</span> into the mainstream. “The more we talk about it, the more comfortable people will feel talking about it and then, maybe, things will change.”</p>

					<p>For too long, she feels, the issue has been swept under the rug. “We can talk about <span class="key" about="environmental issues">emissions</span> and <span class="key" about="environmental issues">climate change</span>, but talking about population gets such an emotional reaction.” However,<span class="mention person" about="Robin Maynard" data-sort="Robin Maynard" data-label="Robin Maynard">Robin Maynard</span>, the director of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/population"><span class="mention org" about="Population Matters" data-sort="Population Matters" data-label="Population Matters"> Population Matters</a>, says he has noticed an upsurge in support, particularly among young people. “You can measure it in our online traffic – our <span class="mention org" about="Twitter" data-sort="Twitter" data-label="Twitter">Twitter</span> followers are up by 60% from 2016 and a recent <span class="mention org" about="Facebook" data-sort="Facebook" data-label="Facebook">Facebook</span> post on being <span class="key" about="child-free">child-free</span> reached more than 4 million people. We are getting more and a wider range of people wanting to join us – and an increase in approaches from donors.” This, he says, “is underpinned by the growing body of scientists stating that <span class="key" about="Humanity">humanity</span> must address the issue of our numbers, as well as our consumption”.</p>

					<p><span class="mention person" about="Leilani Münter" data-sort="Leilani Münter" data-label="Leilani Münter">Münter</span> hadn’t considered the implications of population size until she was in her early 20s. “I was studying biology at the <span class="mention org" about="University of California" data-sort="University of California" data-label="University of California">University of California</span> and came into a lecture that I assumed would be about biochemistry, but the professor showed us a documentary on population.” She says she was “blown away” by the numbers. “It took humans 200,000 years to get to our first billion people, then 126 years to double to 2 billion, 30 years to add another billion and 14 years for the next billion.” Each subsequent billion has only taken 12 years. “It’s pretty scary,” says <span class="mention person" about="Leilani Münter" data-sort="Leilani Münter" data-label="Leilani Münter">Münter</span>.</p>

					<p>We can embrace all the electric cars, renewable energy sources and plant-based foods we like, but, she believes, this can’t make up for <span class="key" about="overpopulation"> overpopulation</span>. <span class="mention person" about="Leilani Münter" data-sort="Leilani Münter" data-label="Leilani Münter">Münter</span> subscribes to one of the most conservative estimates of the Earth’s “carrying capacity” (how many humans the planet can sustainably support) by researchers at <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1999/09/miserable-life-overcrowded-earth-2100"><span class="mention org" about="Cornell University" data-sort="Cornell University" data-label="Cornell University">Cornell University</span> in 1999</a>. “Assuming that all humans are living in relative prosperity, with access to clean water and electricity, that number is 2bn, so we are already 5.6bn over that and rapidly adding people every day.”</p>

					<q>'Your kids and your kid’s kids will be the ones who benefit from humans deciding to slow down our rate of growth'</q>

					<p>The last thing she wants to do is make parents feel guilty, or to shut them out of the conversation. <span class="key" about="procreation">Procreation</span>, after all, is natural. And if you have two children, you are only replacing their parents, rather than adding extras. But if you’re not yet a parent and can’t suppress your parental instincts, says <span class="mention person" about="Leilani Münter" data-sort="Leilani Münter" data-label="Leilani Münter">Münter</span>, “my ask is that you consider adopting one of the 153m orphan children that are already on the planet and need a home. Or, if you are dead set on having your own, my hope would be that you just have one and then if you want more, adopt.” Ultimately, she says, “your kids and your kid’s kids will be the ones who benefit from humans deciding to slow down our rate of growth. It will slow down <span class="key" about="environmental issues">climate change</span>,<span class="key" about="environmental issues">ocean acidification</span>, <span class="key" about="environmental issue">cutting down the wild places</span>.”</p>

					<p>Writing in response to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jeremy-clarkson-im-sure-youll-be-dying-to-hear-about-my-plans-for-a-population-implosion-k7x8pxz90">Münter’s new role</a> with <span class="mention org" about="Population Matters" data-sort="Population Matters" data-label="Population Matters">Population Matters</span>,<span class="mention person" about="Jeremy Clarkson" data-sort="Jeremy Clarkson" data-label="Jeremy Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</span> rolled out the parental platitude that his children “are the point of my <span class="key" about="existence">existence</span>”. This may be true in <span class="mention concept" about="evloution" data-sort="evolution" data-label="evolution">evolutionary terms</span> – our prime biological function is to <span class="key" about="procreation">perpetuate our genes/continue the line</span> – but whether it’s also emotionally/rationally/intellectually true for all parents is moot, and many would say it is a fallacy that life without offspring is necessarily less meaningful.<span class="mention person" about="Leilani Münter" data-sort="Leilani Münter" data-label="Leilani Münter">Münter</span>, an active aunt, argues that she has greater purpose and can make a bigger impact than she would if she were a mother. “I don’t feel like I’m missing out,” she says. “Through my activism, I get to talk at schools and universities, reaching thousands of kids. If I had my own children, I wouldn’t have time. I’m satisfied and fulfilled and don’t need to have a mini-me to pass on these ideas.”</p>

					<p>This view is shared by <span class="mention person" about="Emma Olif" data-sort="Emma Olif" data-label="Emma Olif">Emma Olif</span>, a board member of <span class="mention org" about="Population Matters" data-sort="Population Matters" data-label="Population Matters">Population Matters</span> who lives off-grid in a caravan, travelling between rural <span class="mention place" about="England" data-sort="England" data-label="England">England</span> and <span class="mention place" about="Spain" data-sort="Spain" data-label="Spain">Spain</span>. “People have got very narrow-minded about what it means to be meaningful as a person,” she says. “We have so much opportunity these days to do important things and <span class="key" about="procreation">be pregnant</span> with more than children. We can be pregnant with ideas and dreams and revolution.”</p>

					<p> <span class="procreation" about="procreation">Having children</span>, she says, “from a biological point of view, is probably one of the most selfish things you can do. You’re stealing resources from others in order to perpetuate your genes. I’ve got four siblings; my genes are fine. And the things I want to pass on are intellectual. I will have far more time to do that to a greater number of people if I don’t have children.”</p>

					<p>With a marine biology degree and a masters in biological diversity,<span class="mention person" about="Emma Olif" data-sort="Emma Olif" data-label="Emma Olif">Olif</span>, 30, says she has never had a <span class="mention concept" about="maternal instinct" data-sort="maternal instinct" data-label="maternal instinct">maternal drive</span>, “because I’ve always been aware of everything that’s going on around me, economically, politically and environmentally,” she says. “<span class="key" about="environmental issues">The climate isn’t suitable</span> for having kids at the moment.”</p>

					<p>The argument that many richer countries have falling birthrates doesn’t wash. “The impact of <span class="key" about="Humanity">humanity</span> on the <span class="key" about="environmental issues">environment</span> in the west is significantly more, because we consume more.” She mentions a recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children">Swedish study</a> that found that having one les child per family can save an average of 58.6 tonnes of carbon every year. The next biggest carbon saving you could make is by going car-free, saving a minuscule-by-comparison 2.4 tonnes.</p>

					<q>'When I sum up all the reasons to have, or not to have, a child, it just doesn’t make sense for me'</q>

					<p><span class="mention person" about="Emma Olif" data-sort="Emma Olif" data-label="Emma Olif">Olif</span> frequently gets told that she’s too young to decide not to <span class="key" about="procreate">breed</span>, and that she’ll change her mind. But she is at the age her mother was when she had her. “And all my friends are <span class="key" about="procreate">having children</span>. If they’re old enough to make the decision to <span class="key" about="procreate">have children</span>, surely I’m old enough to make the decision not to.”</p>

					<p>One of the biggest hurdles for women, she acknowledges, is that they can decide they don’t want children, “but physically, their body is raging. We are biologically programmed to <span class="key" about="procreate">have kids</span>.” Which is partly why, she says, “it’s seen as a bit weird not to have kids”.</p>

					<p><span class="mention person" about="Alex Smith" data-sort="Alex Smith" data-label="Alex Smith">Alex Smith</span>, a software developer in <span class="mention place" about="Suffolk" data-sort="Suffolk" data-label="Suffolk">Suffolk</span>, decided as a child not to <span class="key" about="procreate">create</span> any new humans. His wife didn’t want children, either, but throughout their 15 years together, he says, “we’ve revisited it on a regular basis, checking we both still feel the same, and we’ve never changed our minds.” At 41, he’s in a <span class="key" about="child-free">child-free</span> minority, as most of his friends have started families. “My impression is that having a family is just instinctive and natural and most people don’t think about the impact.” He would never tell anyone not to do it, but if the subject comes up in conversation, he’ll politely suggest considering having only one child. “We need to reverse this <span class="key" about="overpopulation">population [growth]</span> and that’s certainly one way to do it.”</p>

					<p>When <span class="mention person" about="Angela Cortal" data-sort="Angela Cortal" data-label="Angela Cortal">Angela</span> and <span class="mention person" about="Xavi Cortal" data-sort="Xavi Cortal" data-label="Xavi Cortal">Xavi Cortal</span>, who live in the <span class="mention place" about="USA" data-sort="USA" data-label="USA">US</span> near <span class="mention place" about="Portland" data-set="Portland" data-label="Portland">Portland</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Oregon" data-sort="Oregon" data-label="Oregon">Oregon</span>, met 12 years ago, <span class="mention person" about="Xavi Cortal" data-sort="Xavi Cortal" data-label="Xavi Cortal">Xavi</span> didn’t want children, but <span class="mention person" about="Angela Cortal" data-sort="Angela Cortal" data-label="Angela Cortal">Angela</span>, a naturopathic doctor, was still undecided. “The narrative was the assumption: of course you’ll have kids, why wouldn’t you continue the family?” But after thinking long and hard, she decided instead “to be connected with family and society in other ways that are fulfilling … I think of myself as a very left-brain, analytical, logical person and when I sum up all the reasons to have, or not to have, a child, it just doesn’t make sense for me.” The pair talked about fostering and adoption, “but we decided to go with a rescue dog instead of a kid,” she says.</p>

					<p>At a summer fair in <span class="mention place" about="Portland" data-set="Portland" data-label="Portland">Portland</span> seven years ago, she met the founder of <span class="mention org" about="VHEMT" data-sort="VHEMT" data-label="VHEMT">VHEMT</span>, <span class="mention person" about="Les Knight" data-sort="Les Knight" data-label="Les Knight">Les Knight</span>. She liked how he had condensed all the data about the <span class="key" about="environmental issues">environmental impact</span> for each person, “acres of forest potentially preserved by each person not brought into the world … It’s very logical in a very tongue-in-cheek way and I don’t think there’s anything I disagree with.” A lot of the reasoning, she says, “might feel confrontational or unwelcome by people of other perspectives”, although the call for actual <span class="key" about="extinction">extinction</span>, she feels is tongue-in-cheek. “I don’t necessarily hope <span class="key" about="Humanity">all humans</span> will die out – I hope we can change the use of resources and impact on the environment.”</p>

					<p><span class="mention person" about="Xavi Cortal" data-sort="Xavi Cortal" data-label="Xavi Cortal">Xavi</span> works for an accredited organic certifying agency and first decided to stay <span class="key" about="child-free">child-free</span> in his 20s, influenced by a woman he was in a relationship with who didn’t want children. Once he considered the benefits – personal and wider – “everywhere I looked I found a new affirmation for my decision.”</p>

					<p>The social pressures for men, he says, are different but still present. “Men seem to have this machismo-based belief that their superior genes need to be carried forward … [but] I think that women have more societal pressure on them to <span class="key" about="procreate">reproduce</span>.” He sees a “disappointing reluctance by men who say they don’t want kids to surgically make sure it doesn’t happen when a vasectomy is so much quicker and less invasive than making a woman undergo tubal ligation. Testes are not sacrosanct.” <span class="mention person" about="Xavi Cortal" data-sort="Xavi Cortal" data-label="Xavi Cortal">Xavi</span> had a vasectomy at 26 and calls it “the best $500 I ever spent”.</p>

					<p>He readily admits that his motivations aren’t entirely selfless. “Child rearing is a miserable, thankless, expensive grind that I don’t see as necessary and that I don’t want to participate in. Of course, my mother loves me and I love her, but why would I want to repeat what I put my parents through? Guilt? Obligation? Duty? No thanks. I get to travel, save money, sleep in if I want to. I get to hang out with other people’s kids and then give them back when they’re rude. There’s really no downside.”</p>

					<p>While he believes the planet would fare better without humans, he says he cannot fathom <span class="key" about="human extinction">human extinction</span>. “This is the world I know. I do a lot of civic work and that has become my children. If I can better the world around me, that’s better than some snotty brat that’s going to tell me that I did a lousy job raising them.” Despite being a supporter of <span class="mention org" about="VHEMT" data-sort="VHEMT" data-label="VHEMT">VHEMT</span>, <span class="mention person" about="Angela Cortal" data-sort="Angela Cortal" data-label="Angela Cortal">Angela</span> wouldn’t call herself an <span class="key" about="anti-natalism">antinatalist</span>, because she associates it with negative feelings towards <span class="key" about="Humanity">humankind</span>. “I don’t, on a human level, resent people who have kids. That wouldn’t be constructive at all. Both my sisters have children.”</p>

					<p>The term is also strongly associated with the writings of the philosopher <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-case-for-not-being-born"><span class="mention person" about="David Benetar" data-sort="David Benetar" data-label="David Benetar">David Benetar</span></a>, the author of Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into <span class="key" about="existence">Existence</span>. <span class="mention person" about="Gwynn Mackellen" data-sort="Gwynn Mackellen" data-label="Gwynn Mackellen">Mackellen</span>, who does call herself an <span class="key" anout="anti-natalism">antinatalist</span>, says her thinking leans his way. “He has thought about it a lot and has come to an acceptance that if creatures are born, they’re going to suffer, therefore let’s not make new ones. I tend to agree.” But she has mixed feelings. “I also work with people in the community and I really enjoy it. I have somewhat of a background in science and I love so many of the things we’ve accomplished. So I’m not completely <span class="key" about="anti-human">anti-human</span>, but I understand where he’s coming from.”</p>

					<p>It’s easy to wonder whether <span class="mention person" about="David Benetar" data-sort="David Benetar" data-label="David Benetar">Benetar</span> and many <span class="key" about="anti-natalism">antinatalists</span> are simply <span class="mention concept" about="depression" data-sort="depression" data-label="depression">depressed</span>.<span class="mention person" about="Gwynn Mackellen" data-sort="Gwynn Mackellen" data-label="Gwynn Mackellen">Mackellen</span> disagrees: “It’s been challenging at times, but for the most part I’ve had a good life,” she says. “I’ve never been <span class="mention concept" about="suicide" data-sort="suicide" data-lablel="suicide">suicidal</span>.

			<p>There are stirrings of discussion these days in philosophical circles about <a href="https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/varied-views-dark-light-in-between-of-earths-anthropocene-age/?mtrref=undefined&gwh=E3F9E4D3571DE47779A2CFF6DDEBE74B&gwt=pay&assetType=PAYWALL">the prospect of <span class="key" about="human extinction" data-sort="human extinction" data-label="human extinction"> human extinction</span></a>. This should not be surprising, given the increasingly threatening predations of <span class="mention concept" about="environmental issues">climate change</span>. In reflecting on this question, I want to suggest an answer to a single question, one that hardly covers the whole philosophical territory but is an important aspect of it. Would <span class="key" about="human extinction" data-sort="human extinction" data-label="human extinction">human extinction</span> be a tragedy?</p>

			<p>To get a bead on this question, let me distinguish it from a couple of other related questions. I’m not asking whether the experience of humans coming to an end would be a bad thing. (In these pages, <a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/the-importance-of-the-afterlife-seriously/?mtrref=undefined&gwh=5768148232E07E23BDC73FC021F7F37F&gwt=pay&assetType=PAYWALL#more-149307"> <span class="mention person" about="Samuel Scheffler" data-sort="Samuel Scheffler" data-label="Samuel Scheffler">Samuel Scheffler</span> has given us</a> an important reason to think that it would be.) I am also not asking whether <span class="key" about="Humanity">human beings</span> as a species deserve to die out. That is an important question, but would involve different considerations. Those questions, and others like them, need to be addressed if we are to come to a full moral assessment of the prospect of our demise. Yet what I am asking here is simply whether it would be a tragedy if <span class="key" about="human extinction">the planet no longer contained <span class="key" about="Humanity">human beings</span>. And the answer I am going to give might seem puzzling at first. I want to suggest, at least tentatively, both that it would be a tragedy and that it might just be a good thing.</p>

			<p>To make that claim less puzzling, let me say a word about tragedy. In theater, the tragic character is often someone who commits a wrong, usually a significant one, but with whom we feel sympathy in their descent. Here <span class="mention person" about="Sophocles" data-sort="Sophocles" data-label="Sophocles"> Sophocles</span>’s <span class="mention person" about="Oedipus" data-sort="Oedipus" data-label="Oedipus">Oedipus</span>, <span class="mention person" about="Shakespeare" data-sort="Shakespeare" data-label="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</span>’s <span class="mention person" about="King Lear" data-sort="King Lear" data-label="King Lear"> Lear</span>, and <span class="mention person" about="Arthur Miller" data-sort="Arthur Miller" data-label="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</span>’s <span class="mention person" about="Willy Loman" data-sort="Willy Loman" data-label="Willy Loman">Willy Loman</span> might stand as examples. In this case, the tragic character is <span class="mention concept" about="Humanity"> humanity</span>. It is <span class="key" about="Humanity">humanity</span> that is committing a wrong, a wrong whose elimination would likely require the <span class="key" about="human extinction">elimination of the species</span>, but with whom we might be sympathetic nonetheless for reasons I discuss in a moment.</p>

			<p>To make that case, let me start with a claim that I think will be at once depressing and, upon reflection, uncontroversial. <span class="key" abou="Humanity"> Human beings</span> are <span class="key" about="environmental issues">destroying large parts of the inhabitable earth</span> and causing unimaginable <span class="key" about="animal suffering">suffering to many of the animals</span> that inhabit it. This is happening through at least three means. First, human contribution to <span class="key" about="environmental issues">climate change</span> is devastating ecosystems, as the recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/15/climate/yellowstone-global-warming.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=898A4C4CE4FC27F102125939B59EA32F&gwt=pay&assetType=PAYWALL">article on <span class="mention place" about="Yellowstone Park">Yellowstone Park</span></a> in <span class="mention org" about="The New York Times">The Times</span> exemplifies. Second,<span class="key" about="overpopulation">increasing human population</span> is <span class="key" about="environmental issues">encroaching on ecosystems</span> that would otherwise be intact. Third, factory farming fosters the creation of millions upon millions of animals for whom it offers nothing but <span class="key" about="animal suffering">suffering</span> and misery before <span class="key" about="animal suffering">slaughtering</span> them in often barbaric ways. There is no reason to think that those practices are going to diminish any time soon. Quite the opposite.</p>

			<p> <span class="key" about="Humanity">Humanity</span>, then, is the source of <span class="key" about="animal suffering">devastation of the lives of conscious animals</span> on a scale that is difficult to comprehend.</p>

			<p>To be sure, nature itself is hardly a Valhalla of peace and harmony. Animals kill other animals regularly, often in ways that we (although not they) would consider cruel. But there is no other creature in nature whose predatory behavior is remotely as deep or as widespread as the behavior we display toward what the philosopher <span class="mention person" about="Christine Korsgaard" data-sort="Christine Korsgaard" data-label="Christine Korsgaard">Christine Korsgaard</span> aptly calls “our fellow creatures” in a sensitive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/15/climate/yellowstone-global-warming.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=898A4C4CE4FC27F102125939B59EA32F&gwt=pay&assetType=PAYWALL">book</a> of the same name.</p>

			<p>If this were all to the story there would be no tragedy. <span class="mention concept" about="Human Extinction">The elimination of the human species</span> would be a good thing, full stop. But there is more to the story. <span class="key" about="Humanity">Human beings</span> bring things to the planet that other animals cannot. For example, we bring an advanced level of reason that can experience wonder at the world in a way that is foreign to most if not all other animals. We create art of various kinds: literature, music and painting among them. We engage in sciences that seek to understand the universe and our place in it. Were <span class="key" about="Humanity">our species</span> to go <span class="key" about="extinction">extinct</span>, all of that would be lost.</p>

			<p>Now there might be those on the more jaded side who would argue that if we went <span class="key" about="extinction">extinct</span> there would be no loss, because there would be no one for whom it would be a loss not to have access to those things. I think this objection misunderstands our relation to these practices. We appreciate and often participate in such practices because we believe they are good to be involved in, because we find them to be worthwhile. It is the goodness of the practices and the experiences that draw us. Therefore, it would be a loss to the world if those practices and experiences ceased to <span class="key" about="existence">exist</span>.</p>

			<p>One could press the objection here by saying that it would only be a loss from a human viewpoint, and that that viewpoint would no longer exist if we went <span class="key" about="extinction">extinct</span>. This is true. But this entire set of reflections is taking place from a human viewpoint. We cannot ask the questions we are asking here without situating them within the human practice of philosophy. Even to ask the question of whether it would be a tragedy if <span class="key" about="human extinction">humans were to disappear from the face of the planet</span> requires a normative framework that is restricted to <span class="key" about="Humanity">human beings</span>.</p>

			<p>Let’s turn, then, and take the question from the other side, the side of those who think that <span class="key" about="human extinction"> human extinction</span> would be both a tragedy and overall a bad thing. Doesn’t the <span class="key" about="existence"> existence</span> of those practices outweigh the harm we bring to the <span class="key" about="environmental issues">environment</span> and the <span class="key" about="animal suffering">animals</span> within it? Don’t they justify the continued <span class="key" about="existence"> existence</span> of <span class="key" about="Humanity">our species</span>, even granting the <span class="key" about="animal suffering">suffering</span> we bring to so many nonhuman lives?</p>

			<p>To address that question, let us ask another one. How many human lives would it be worth sacrificing to preserve the <span class="key" about="existence">existence</span> of <span class="mention person" about="Shakespeare" data-sort="Shakespeare" data-label="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</span>’s works? If we were required to engage in human sacrifice in order to save his works from eradication, how many humans would be too many? For my own part, I think the answer is one. One human life would be too many (or, to prevent quibbling, one innocent human life), at least to my mind. Whatever the number, though, it is going to be quite low.</p>

			<p>Or suppose a terrorist planted a bomb in the <span class="mention org" about="Museum Louvre">Louvre</span> and the first responders had to choose between saving several people in the museum and saving the art. How many of us would seriously consider saving the art?</p>

			<p>So, then, how much <span class="key" about="animal suffering">suffering and death of nonhuman life</span> would we be willing to countenance to save <span class="Shakespeare" about="Shakespeare" data-sort="Shakespeare" data-label="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</span>, our sciences and so forth? Unless we believe there is such a profound moral gap between the status of human and nonhuman animals, whatever reasonable answer we come up with will be well surpassed by the <span class="key" about="animal suffering">harm and suffering we inflict upon animals</span>. There is just too much <span class="key" about="animal suffering">torment wreaked upon too many animals</span> and too certain a prospect that this is going to continue and probably increase; it would overwhelm anything we might place on the other side of the ledger. Moreover, those among us who believe that there is such a gap should perhaps become more familiar with the richness of lives of many of our conscious fellow creatures. Our own science is revealing that richness to us, ironically giving us a reason to eliminate it along with our own continued <span class="key" about="existence">existence</span>.</p>

			<p>One might ask here whether, given this view, it would also be a good thing for those of us who are currently here to end our lives in order to prevent further <span class="key" about="animal suffering">animal suffering</span>. Although I do not have a final answer to this question, we should recognize that the case of future humans is very different from the case of currently <span class="key" about="existence">existing</span> humans. To demand of currently <span class="key" about="existence">existing</span> humans that they should end their lives would introduce significant suffering among those who have much to lose by dying. In contrast, preventing future humans from <span class="key" about="existence">existing</span> does not introduce such suffering, since those human beings will not <span class="key" about="existence">exist</span> and therefore not have lives to sacrifice. The two situations, then, are not analogous.</p>

			<p>It may well be, then, that <span class="key" about="human extinction">the extinction of humanity</span> would make the world better off and yet would be a tragedy. I don’t want to say this for sure, since the issue is quite complex. But it certainly seems a live possibility, and that by itself disturbs me.</p>

			<p>There is one more tragic aspect to all of this. In many dramatic tragedies, the suffering of the protagonist is brought about through his or her own actions. It is <span class="mention person" about="Oedipus" data-sort="Oedipus" data-label="Oedipus">Oedipus</span>’s killing of his father that starts the train of events that leads to his tragic realization; and it is <span class="mention person" about="King Lear" data-sort="King Lear" data-label="King Lear">Lear</span>’s highhandedness toward his daughter <span class="mention person" about="Cordelia" data-sort="Cordelia" data-label="Cordelia">Cordelia</span> that leads to his demise. It may also turn out that it is through our own actions that we <span class="key" about="humanity">human beings</span> bring about our <span class="key" about="human extinction">extinction</span>, or at least something near it, contributing through our practices to our own tragic end.</p>

					<p>They will know us by the trail of our dead: Humans have spent roughly 60,000 years causing mass <span class="key" about="extinctions">extinctions</span> and we’re only getting better at it. Though the environmental movement is as big as it’s ever been, human <span class="key" about="environmental issues">ecological destruction</span> has become compulsive to the point that it’s taken as almost a given that the Anthropocene will necessitate the terraformation of Mars. But not everyone is ready to give up on this planet. <span class="mention person" about="Les Knight" data-sort="Les Knight" data-label="Les Knight">Les Knight</span>, leader of the <a href="http://www.vhemt.org"><span class="mention org" about="VHEMT">Voluntary Human Extinction Movement</span></a> (because the acronym is <span class="mention org" about="VHEMT">Voluntary Human Extinction Movement VHEMT</span>, the movement goes by “Vehement”) has what is essentially a political solution: He wants mankind to agree on a set of policies designed to end <span class="key" about="Humanity">mankind.</p>

					<p>Let’s be clear: Genocide is not one of those policies. Knight isn’t <span class="key" about="anti-human">anti-human</span> so much as he’s <span class="key" about="anti-natalism">anti-procreation</span>.

					<p><b>Tell us about the <span class="mention org" about="VHEMT">VHEMT</span> movement. Should we be trying to bring about our own <span class="key" about="extinction">extinction?</span></b></p>

					<p>The idea has probably been around for a long time, but if it was recorded it got erased. Many people have independently come to the conclusion that planet Earth’s biosphere would be far better off if Homo sapiens weren’t a part of it. Some people say <span class="key" about="pro-natalism"> pronatalist</span>, but I think that’s redundant. That’s the dominant mindset that we have. All cultures have evolved to be <span class="key" about="pro-natalism">natalist</span> because if you’re not a <span class="key" about="pro-natalism">natalist</span> culture you’ll probably die out. It’s gotten us to where we are today. So what we’re recommending is people think before they <span class="key" about="procreation">breed</span>.</p>

					<p><b>But isn’t our only objective as a species to proliferate and survive?</b></p>

					<p>If people think it all the way through, they probably won’t. It’s our <span class="key" about="pro-natalism">natalist</span> conditioning — our cultural indoctrination — that leads everyone to think this is what we do. We grow up, we get married, we <span class="key" about="procreation">have babies</span>, a career, it’s the default life. And if you don’t do that, you’ve got to have some good reasons not to, whereas it should be the other way around. We need to think about why we want to create another one of ourselves when we’re not taking care of all the people that are here today and our increase is causing the <span class="key" about="extinction">extinction</span> of so many other species. We have to live somewhere and, wherever we live, not much else lives. It’s unfortunate for the things that used to live there. It’s totally voluntary. So <span class="key" about="procreation">reproductive framework</span> is an absolutely essential aspect until people all over the world have the ability and the <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">freedom</span> to not <span class="key" about="procreation">procreate</span>, if they don’t want to. It doesn’t do much good to try to convince people to not <span class="key" about="procreation">procreate</span>.</p>

					<p><b>So, <span class="key" about="VHEMT">VHEMT</span> wants people to choose to do it on their own.</b></p>

					<p>Yes, that’s right. First, we want to eliminate unwanted and unintended pregnancies, and then we want to encourage people not to want that in the first place. There are many other ways of spending one’s lifetime.</p>

					<p><b>Certain presidential candidates might make it a lot easier to do the former. Which candidate is <span class="key" about="VHEMT">VHEMT</span> behind?</b></p>

					<p>Rather than looking at candidates, I look at policy. The policy of the candidate is what really matters. <span class="mention person" about="Jill Stein" data-sort="Jill Stein" data-label="Jill Stein">Jill Stein</span> of the <span class="mention org" about="Gree Party">Green Party</span> and both <span class="mention org" about="Democratic Party">Democratic</span> candidates have expressed support for <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">reproductive freedom</span>, including the right to choose. They also encourage <span class="key" about="gender equality">gender equality</span>, which is very important in addition to <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">reproductive freedom</span>. It actually goes hand in hand. Without <span class="key" about="gender equality">gender equality</span>, there’s rarely <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">reproductive freedom</span>. There are politicians who are actively trying to remove <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">reproductive freedom</span> by eliminating funding, and they’re also trying to eliminate the results of their meddling with peoples’ <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">reproductive freedom</span>. For example, in <span class="mention place" about="New Jersey">New Jersey</span>, Governor <span class="mention person" about="Chris Christie" data-sort="Chris Christie" data-label="Chris Christie">Chris Christie</span> eliminated all family planning funding in 2010. They also are staunchly opposed to <span class="mention concept" about="abortion">abortion</span>. These two things, they really haven’t put them together. The way to prevent <span class="mention concept" about="abortion">abortions</span> is to prevent unwanted conceptions: Almost all <span class="key" about="abortion">abortions</span> are the result of unwanted conceptions, so it’s hard to understand what it is unless somebody wants to think they just want to control women. I don’t know how somebody could get into the position of governor if that’s their main mission.</p>

					<p>There’s so much outrage and indignation about any attempt to restrict people’s freedom to <span class="key" about="procreation">procreate</span>, which we’re in favor of. But there’s hardly a peep about all this restriction of people’s abilities to not procreate. It’s a basic human right to be able to not create another one of us if people don’t want to. And yet it’s so pervasive in our culture. It’s quite ignored that people don’t have the <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">freedom to not procreate</span>! That’s really very cruel. I think it’s far worse to force someone to <span class="key" about="procreation">procreate</span> when they don’t want to than it is to restrict their <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">freedom to procreate</span> when they want to do more.</p>

					<p>I don’t know who could be against <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">planning their parenthood</span>. I think something so important as bringing a new life into the world should be planned. But rather than eliminating the traditional view of family, I think we need to expand it so that it includes other definitions of family. There’s an expression — “love makes a family” — and I think it’s true. Not unconventional families, not just adoption, but fostering, step-parenting, people getting together and calling it a family. People really need a sense of belonging. It’s really essential to our well-being, to belong to a community. That’s part of the reason a lot of people <span class="key" about="procreation">procreate</span>. If you want to be a part of a community, you’ll get a lot of likes on <span class="mention org" about="Facebook">Facebook</span> for it too!

It doesn’t really apply to <span class="mention org" about="VHEMT">VHEMT</span> because the numbers are so few that it wouldn’t make a difference. We’re really advocating fewer births rather than more deaths. But, when somebody is terminally ill, it seems cruel to force them to stay alive to the end when they would like to have some control over the last thing that they do, which is die.</p>

					<p><b>If you were <span class="mention org" about="VHEMT">VHEMT</span>’s third-party presidential candidate, what would your platform be?</b></p>

					<p>First of all, of course <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">reproductive freedom</span>, absolutely everyone who doesn’t want to <span class="key" about="procreation">procreate</span> has the wherewithal not to. That would include surgical contraception, which is very difficult. I would approach it as taking care of everyone who is here already. We’re not doing that very well. Until we can take care of everyone on the planet, really, it’s not just our country, those are artificial constructions, the human family is all one family and tens of thousands of our children are dying every day of preventable causes. So I don’t see how we can continue making more of them. I probably wouldn’t get elected [laughter].</p>

					<p><b>The idea here is that we’re going to voluntarily become <span class="key" about="extinction">extinct</span> to let all of the Earth’s other species continue to thrive. But why us?</b></p>

					<p>Yeah, why us? How did that work out? How did we become the mammal that crossed the intelligence barrier and self-awareness and technology and then all of a sudden became sapiens? Well we like to call ourselves sapiens, we named ourselves twice even! But for a million years, all we had was a chopping stone and did just fine. As far as we know, we didn’t wipe out species. So when we got the use of fire, we did alter things and some species may have gone <span class="key" about="extinction">extinct</span>, but nothing like when we really started changing ecosystems with the wholesale of agriculture. Even our hunting and gathering probably didn’t cause as much damage. Exotic species such as ourselves, everywhere we went we left a trail of <span class="key" about="extinction">extinctions</span>. In Australia, the food didn’t recognize us as a predator so we could just club them in the head and eat it.</p>

					<p><b>What you’re saying is that this is <span class="key" about="Humanity">humankind</span>’s unique burden.</b></p>

					<p>It’s true. We’re the only species to ever consider our own <span class="key" about="reproductive freedom">voluntary</span> <span class="key" about="extinction">extinction</span>. Or needs to.</p>
