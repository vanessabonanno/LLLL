						<p>If the <span class="mention org" about="IRS">IRS</span> determines that the <span class="mention concept" about="investment">investment fund</span> failed to act as a <span class="mention concept" about="charity">charity</span> even though it benefited from <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span> breaks, it might find that <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> <a href="https://bycommonconsent.com/2019/12/17/some-thoughts-about-ensign-peak-advisers-and-the-church/">broke <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span> laws</a>.

Like many communities in antebellum <span class="mention place" about="USA" data-sort="USA" data-label="United States" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America</span>, <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> was land-rich and <span class="mention concept" about="money">cash-poor</span>.

						<p>The idea of <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> leaders <span class="mention concept" about="currency">printing their own money</span> wasn’t as crazy as it sounds in 2019.

						<p>At this point, church leaders took a more fateful and dubious step.</p>

						<p>They had collected <span class="mention concept" about="money">money</span> from <span class="mention concept" about="investment">investors</span> and had already begun printing <span class="mention concept" about="currency">notes</span> of the “<a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_835201"><span class="mention org" about="KirtlandSafetySocietyBank" data-sort="KirtlandSafetySocietyBank" data-label="Kirtland Safety Society Bank" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtland_Safety_Society"><span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> Safety Society Bank</span></a>.” Instead of shutting down the operation when the charter failed to come through, they doubled down. Worried about the <span class="mention concept" about="law">legal risk</span> of running an unchartered bank, church leaders altered the <span class="mention concept" about="currency">notes</span> to read “anti-Banking-Co.”</p>

						<p>For a while, all went well. “<span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> <span class="mention concept" about="currency">bills</span> are as safe as gold,” <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674416857">one church member wrote</a> in January 1837. The town enjoyed a short-lived boom.</p>

						<p>Soon, however, the anti-bank proved anything but safe. Non-<span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormons</span> questioned the society’s ability to redeem its <span class="mention concept" about="currency">notes</span>, and church leaders could not keep it afloat. The <span class="mention org" about="KirtlandSafetySocietyBank"><span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> Safety Society</span>’s struggles were not unusual. Scores of banks, including some of the nation’s largest, failed in what became the <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801478864/americas-first-great-depression/"><span class="mention concept" about="Panic1837" data-sort="PaniceOf1837" data-label="Panic of 1837" url= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837">Panic of 1837</span></a>. Real estate speculators lost their fortunes, and workers lost their jobs.</p>

						<p>What made <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> different was the bank’s ownership. Many church members lost not only confidence in the society’s <span class="mention concept" about="currency">banknotes</span>, but faith in the prophet who had signed them.</p>

						<p>The crisis divided the church. At one point that summer, church members wielding pistols and bowie knives fought with each other in the temple. <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Smith</span> and one of his top associates were <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/topic/kirtland-safety-society">convicted of issuing <span class="mention concept" about="currency">banknotes</span> without a charter</a> and fined <span class="mention concept" about="money">$1,000</span> each. They soon fled the courts and their creditors, taking refuge with fellow church members in <span class="mention place" about="Missouri" data-sort="Missouri" data-label="Missouri" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri">Missouri</span>.</p>

						<p>After anti-<span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> mobs forced the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">Latter-day Saints</span> out of <span class="mention place" about="Missouri">Missouri</span> and then <span class="mention place" about="Illinois" data-sort="Illinoise" data-label="Illinois" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois">Illinois</span>, <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Smith</span>’s successor, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/religion/brigham-young"><span class="mention person" about="BrighamYoung" data-sort="YoungBrigham" data-label="Brigham Young"url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young">Brigham Young</span></a>, led thousands of church members to what became the <span class="mention place" about="Utah Territory" data-sort="UtahTerritory" data-label="Utah Territory" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Territory">Utah Territory</span>.</p>

						<p>In the late 1860s, <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormons</span> built the <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469653204/railroading-religion/"><span class="mention concept" about="UtahCentralRailroad" data-sort="UtahCentralRailroad" data-label="Utah Central Railroad" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Central_Railroad_(1869%E2%80%931881)">Utah Central Railroad</span></a>, which connected <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity" data-sort="SaltLakeCity" data-label="Salt Lake City" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City">Salt Lake City</span> with <span class="mention place" about="Ogden" data-sort="Ogden" data-label="Ogden" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogden,_Utah">Ogden</span> – a stop along <span class="mention concept" about="transcontientalrailroad" data-sort="TranscontinentalRailroad" data-label="The Transcontinental Railroad" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_railroad">the transcontinental railroad</span>.

						<p>Beginning in 1868, the church also operated the <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=4083139&itype=CMSID"><span class="mention org" about="ZionsCooperativeMecantileInstitution" data-sort="ZionsCooperativeMecantileInstitution" data-label="Zion's Cooperative Mecantile Institution" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZCMI">Zion’s Cooperative Mercantile Institution</span></a>, a department store designed to put the squeeze on non-<span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> businesses.</p>

						<p>The church sold the store in 1999, but in many ways its <span class="mention concept" about="finance">commercial interests</span> have become more grandiose since its frontier days of railroading and retailing.</p>

						<p>In 2003, the church’s <span class="mention concept" about="profit">for-profit</span> real estate division purchased the land on which the store had stood. Nine years later, the estimated <span class="mention concept" about="money">$1.5 billion</span> <a href="https://archive.curbed.com/2018/3/20/17142760/salt-lake-city-downtown-development-hot-market"><span class="mention place"about="CityCreekCenter" data-sort="CityCreekCenter" data-label="City Creek Center" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Creek_Center">City Creek Center</span></a> development opened to the public, including a glitzy mall.</p>

						<p>At the time, <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=54478720&itype=cmsid">church officials asserted</a> that they had not used any <span class="mention concept" about="tithing" data-sort="tithing" data-label="tithing" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe"> tithing</span> money on the <span class="mention place"about="CityCreekCenter">City Creek</span> project.

						<p>The <span class="mention person" about="DavidNielsen"><span class="mention person" about="LarsNielsen">Nielsen brothers</span></span> allege that <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mormon-church-stockpiled-100-billion-intended-charities-misled-lds-members-whistleblower-says-1477809">diverted  <span class="mention concept" about="money">$1.4 billion</span> in <span class="mention concept" about="tithing">tithing</span> funds</a> to pay for the development, a possible violation of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations"><span class="mention org" about="IRS">IRS</span> rules that govern <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span>-exempt institutions</a>.</p>

						<p>It is impossible to confirm the accusation without greater transparency on the part of <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span>, which has told <a href="https://religionunplugged.com/news/2019/12/16/whistleblower-exposes-100-billion-stockpile-by-mormon-church"><span class="mention org" about="ReligionUnplugged" data-sort="ReligionUnplugged" data-label="Religion Unplugged" url="https://religionunplugged.com/">Religion Unplugged</span></a>, a <span class="mention concept" about="charity">nonprofit</span> media outlet, that it “does not provide information about specific <span class="mention concept" about="finance">transactions</span> or <span class="mention concept" about="finance">financial decisions</span>.”</p>

						<p>According to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ef2n0uEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"><span class="mention person" about="SamuelBurnson" data-sort="BrunsonSamuel" data-label="Samuel Brunson" url="https://www.luc.edu/law/faculty/facultyandadministrationprofiles/brunson-samuel.shtml">Samuel Brunson<span></a>, a <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span> <span class="mention concept" about="law">law</span> professor, the church was <a href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Mormonism_and_church_finances/Twenty-first_century/Disclosure">more open</a> about its <span class="mention concept" about="finance">ledger sheet</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="finance">business arrangements</span> during the first half of the 20th century.</p>

						<p>Then, in the mid- to late 1950s, it <a href="https://sunstone.org/pdf/102-17-29.pdf">lost approximately <span class="mention concept" about="money">$10 million</span></a> in municipal bond <span class="mention concept" about="investment">investments</span>. The resulting embarrassment was one factor in <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span>’s decision to become less forthcoming about its <span class="mention concept" about="finance">finances</span>.</p>

						<p>In this respect, <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span> is not unique. <span class="mention place" about="USA">U.S.</span> laws do not require churches to disclose their <span class="mention concept" about="finance">financial information</span> in much detail. While some churches do so voluntarily, others – including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/07/17/facing-financial-boycott-west-virginias-catholic-diocese-agrees-hire-new-auditor-make-findings-public/"><span class="mention org" about="CatholicChurch" data-sort="CatholicChurch" data-label="Catholic Church" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Catholic Church</span></a> – keep their <span class="mention concept" about="finance">financial and commercial interests</span> <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/how-rich-is-the-catholic-church-it-s-impossible-to-tell-13295788">shrouded from public view</a>.</p>

					<h2 class="subheading1" id="art1sub5">Saving for a ‘rainy decade’</h2>
					
						<p>It remains to be seen whether <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> is going to become the subject of <span class="mention org" about="IRS">IRS</span> investigations.</p>

						<p>There are, of course, ethical and moral questions in addition to <span class="mention concept" about="law">legal</span> ones. For example, should the church amass so much money? And might the church use more of its excess <span class="mention concept" about="finance">funds</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="investment">investment</span> <span class="mention concept" about="profit">gains</span> for <span class="mention concept" about="charity">humanitarian purposes</span> or to make the tuition at church-owned <a href="https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-tuition-increase-three-percent-2019-2020-academic-year"><span class="mention org" about="BYU" data-sort="BYU" data-label="Brigham Young University" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University">Brigham Young University</span></a> even more affordable?</p>

						<p>What’s also at stake is confidence in <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span>’s leaders. <span class="mention person" about="MittRomney" data-sort="RomneyMitt" data-label="Mitt Romney" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">Sen.

						<p><span class="mention person" about="MittRomney">Romney</span>’s perspective makes some historical sense, given that the most obvious problem in <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Ohio">Ohio</span>, was that <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Joseph Smith</span>’s <span class="mention concept" about="finance">financial</span> stewardship was decidedly unwise.

The ten-acre complex is the closest thing to the <span class="mention place"about="Vatican" data-sort="Vatican" data-label="Vatican City" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City">Vatican City</span> for the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">Latter-Day Saint</span> (LDS) faith. Within its lush surroundings, it houses the world’s most prominent <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> temple. Visitors are welcome to visit the grounds, and as you walk through the immaculately groomed facility, you’ll inevitably catch the eye of a young <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionary</span>.</p>

						<p><span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormonism</span> is a famously proselytizing faith. A common rite of passage for young Mormon men (and women, albeit to a lesser extent) is to embark upon a <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">mission</span>, where they dedicate as much as two years of their life to spread their faith, often thousands of miles from home. But what happens when their <span class="mention concept" about="mission">mission</span> ends and they return to secular life?</p>

						<p>In many cases, they’re finding success in <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s burgeoning technology sector, either working on the front-line of sales or software development, or even founding innovative companies themselves. Indeed, one could even make a compelling case that returned <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS</span> <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionaries</span> are the “secret sauce” behind the frenetic growth of the <span class="mention place" about="SiliconSlopes" data-sort="SiliconSlopes" data-label="Silicon Slopes" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Slopes">Silicon Slopes</span> scene.</p>

					<h2 class="subheading2" id="art2sub1">The <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> Success Story</h2>

						<p>“<span class="mention place" about="SiliconSlopes">Silicon Slopes</span>” refers to two things; the first is a geographical area that encompasses <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span> and many of the surrounding towns, including <span class="mention place" about="Lehi" data-sort="Lehi" data-label="Lehi" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi,_Utah">Lehi</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Provo" data-sort="Provo" data-label="Provo" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provo,_Utah">Provo</span>, and <span class="mention place" about="Orem" data-sort="Orem" data-label="Orem" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orem,_Utah">Orem</span>. The second is a <a href="https://siliconslopes.com/">501(c) non-profit organization</a> that advocates for technology companies in this area.</p>

						<p>Outside of the state, <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> isn’t especially well-known for its <span class="mention concept" about="startup">startup</span> scene. It’s undeniably overshadowed by <span class="mention place" about="SanFrancisco" data-sort="SanFrancisco" data-label="San Francisco" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</span> and <span class="mention place" about="NewYorkCity" data-sort="NewYorkCity" data-label="New York City" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York</span>, both of which house most of <span class="mention place" about="USA" data-sort="USA" data-label="United States" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America</span>’s leading technology companies. These two cities attract the lion’s share of venture capital money, and therefore command most of the media attention.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="imgs\mormons2\img2.jpg">
						</figure>

						<p>Despite that relative obscurity, <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> has produced some astounding success stories. The most well-known is arguably the <span class="mention place" about="Farmington" data-sort="Farmington" data-label="Farmington" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmington,_Utah">Farmington</span>-based <span class="mention org" about="Pluralsight" data-sort="Pluralsight" data-label="Pluralsight" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralsight"><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a></span>, which runs a training platform designed for technology professionals. Last year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/pluralsight-ps-ipo-stock-starts-trading-on-nasdaq.html">it went public</a>, raising <span class="mention concept" about="money" data-sort="money" data-label="money" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money">$310.5 million</span> and cementing the company’s rightful place in “unicorn” territory.</p>

						<p>Beyond <span class="mention org" about="Pluralsight">Pluralsight</span>, there’s at least three other unicorn-level technology companies operating within the state of <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>. The customer experience firm <span class="mention org" about="Qualtrics" data-sort="Qualtrics" data-label="Qualtrics" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualtrics"><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a></span>, for example, was acquired by <span class="mention org" about="SAP" data-sort="SAP" data-label="SAP" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP">SAP</span> in 2018 <a href="https://news.sap.com/2019/01/sap-completes-qualtrics-acquisition/">for a cool <span class="mention concept" about="money">$8 billion</span></a>. Another <span class="mention concept" about="startup">startup</span>, <span class="mention org" about="Domo" data-sort="Domo" data-label="Domo" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domo_(company)">Domo</span>, creates cloud analytics software and was valued at <span class="mention concept" about="money">$2 billion</span> when it went public last year. <span class="mention org" about="InsideSales" data-sort="InsideSales" data-label="InsideSales" url="https://en.everybodywiki.com/InsideSales.com"><a href="https://www.InsideSales.com">InsideSales</a></span> is also believed to be worth <span class="mention concept" about="money">over a billion dollars</span>, although the precise figure isn’t exactly known.</p>

						<p>But if you really want to measure the success of <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s <span class="mention concept" about="startup">startup</span> scene, you don’t need to read <span class="mention org" about="TechCrunch" data-sort="TechCrunch" data-label="TechCrunch" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch">TechCrunch</span> or <span class="mention org" data-sort="WallStreetJournal" data-label="The Wall Street Journal" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal">The Wall Street Journal</span>. You just need to fly to <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span> and look out of your window as the plane makes its descent. The picturesque mountains that surround the state’s capital are quite pockmarked with massive, high-tech office buildings that house an army of developers and assorted technologists. And a great many of these workers are returned <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionaries</span>.</p>

					<h2 class="subheading2"id="art2sub2">The <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">Missionary</span> Life</h2>
					
						<p>It’s entirely possible you’ve encountered a <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionary</span> before. They might have stopped you in the street or knocked on your door. Perhaps you’ve even invited one into your home to perform a bible reading, or so you can ask more probing questions about the faith. But most of us don’t actually know what the day-to-day life of a smartly dressed <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionary</span> is like.</p>

						<p>Suffice to say, it’s a remarkable departure from everyday life. As one <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionary</span> I spoke to in <span class="mention place" about="TempleSquare">Temple Square</span> explained, it’s a life of discipline and ascetism, where choices are made on your behalf by other senior officials in the church. When you put on your suit and name badge, you effectively relinquish your free will.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="imgs\mormons2\img3.jpg">
						</figure>

						<p><span class="mention concept" about="missionary">Missionaries</span> get no choice of where they serve, nor who they serve with. They are always supposed to remain within reach of their companions, except for when using the shower or restroom. Privacy simply isn’t a thing.</p>

						<p>Six days a week, <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS</span> <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionaries</span> perform their duties. On their sole day off, they’re allowed to email or write (and, as of February this year, call) home. They are commanded to refrain from secular entertainment. They avoid popular music, instead listening to hymns or EFYs (which stands for “especially for youth,” and is a subgenre of contemporary music that’s firmly rooted in <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> theology).</p>

						<p>And crucially, <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionaries</span> need an unbelievably thick skin. They routinely deal with rejection. Sometimes this is manifested in a polite “no.” Sometimes it isn’t. <span class="mention concept" about="religion" data-sort="religion" data-label="religion" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">Faith</span>, after all, is perhaps the most personal thing there is.</p>

					<h2 class="subheading2" id="art2sub3">Heading to the slopes</h2>
					
						<p>After a young <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> concludes their <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">mission</span>, they began their return into secular life. Having discharged their solemn duties to their church and their God, they’re able to pursue more worldly goals, like family, education, and a career.</p>

						<p>And inevitably, many find their way into local technology companies, where they become a valuable resource. As <span class="mention org" about="Pluralsight">Pluralsight</span> CEO <span class="mention person" about="Aaron Skonnard" data-sort="SkonnardAaron" data-label="AaronSkonnard" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Skonnard"><a href="https://twitter.com/skonnard">Aaron Skonnard</a></span> explained, much of this value derives from the experiences and skills gained during <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missions</span>.</p>

						<p>“I do think there’s something transformative about that experience that produces leadership qualities, selling skills, and high EQ [emotional quotient],” he told me.</p>

						<p>“It’s an incubator for those skills, because you’ve got to live with people you’ve never met before. You’re assigned a companion who you’re with 24/7 until you get changed. And you’re constantly being rotated between different companions – which you have no choice or input into. And then you go out and sell the hardest thing it is to sell, which is <span class="mention concept" about="religion">religion</span>.”</p>

						<p><span class="mention concept" about="religion">Religion</span> isn’t just deeply personal. To the faithful, it’s the fundamental basis of how they understand the world. Scripture provides a rulebook for life, and addresses the questions of “where did I come from” and “where will I go?” As <span class="mention person" about="AaronSkonnard">Skonnard</span> points out, talking about this with absolute strangers requires a level of emotional intelligence.</p>

						<p>“Being a <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionary</span> requires a deep ability to relate with people. To understand what their motivations are, where they are in their lives, and why they’d consider making a change of something as big as their <span class="mention concept" about="religion">religion</span>. In that whole process you make those whole EQ sills, and learn how to ‘close the deal’,” <span class="mention person" about="AaronSkonnard">Skonnard</span> said.</p>

						<p>This is arguably why <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s economy (and not merely the technology sector) is heavily dominated by sales companies. This culture, plus a cheap and youthful labor pool, has attracted large blue-chip companies like <span class="mention org" about="HomeDepot" data-sort="HomeDepot" data-label="HomeDepot" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot">Home Depot</span> and <span class="mention org" data-sort="Esurance" data-label="Esurance" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esurance">Esurance</span> to <a href="https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html">open call centers within the state</a>.</p>

						<p><span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> is also the birthplace of countless multi-level marketing (MLM) companies, the top nine of which collectively earned <span class="mention concept" about="money">$7.6 billion</span> in revenue during 2017 alone. This proliferation of questionable network marketing schemes has resulted in a cruel joke that states the acronym “MLM” actually stands for “<span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormons</span> losing <span class="mention concept" about="money">money</span>.”</p>

						<p>And then there’s the language factor. Although the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS</span> <span class="mention concept" about="religion">faith</span> originated in the <span class="mention place" about="USA">United States</span>, it’s since spread globally, with <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionaries</span> working across the world. One <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionary</span> told me about a friend who was transplanted from <span class="mention place" data-sort="Australia" data-label="Australia" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</span> to <span class="mention place" about="HongKong" data-sort="HongKong" data-label="Hong Kong" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</span>, and therefore had to learn Cantonese. Another former <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionary</span>, 2012 presidential candidate <span class="mention person" about="MittRomney" data-sort="RomneyMitt" data-label="Mitt Romney" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">Mitt Romney</span>, speaks fluent French thanks to his time in <span class="mention place" about="Paris" data-sort="Paris" data-label="Paris" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</span>.</p>

						</figure>
						
						<p><span><span class="mention concept" about="missionary">Missionaries</span> carry these language skills into later life, making them even more valuable to <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s technology companies, which are increasingly outward looking.</span></p>

					<h2 class="subheading2"id="art2sub4">More than just <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionaries</span></h2>
					
						<p>Of course, <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s recent technological success is the product of several factors, with the prevalence of former <span class="mention concept" about="missionary">missionaries</span> being just one. It benefits from several highly regarded universities, all with excellent Computer Science programs that pump out talented (<a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-1-university-in-the-u-s-for-spinning-off-startups-may-surprise-you">and often entrepreneurial</a>) developers.</p>

						<p>There’s also an important cultural factor. <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s companies are more conservative than their <span class="mention place" about="California" data-sort="California" data-label="California" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">Californian</span> counterparts. VC capital is comparatively harder to obtain than in <span class="mention place" about="SiliconValley" data-sort="SiliconValley" data-label="Silicon Valley" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</span>, so companies must achieve profitability early. This creates companies that are ultimately more sustainable, and based on long-term aspirations.</p>

						<p>And maybe it’s <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> itself.</p>
				
						<p>I spoke to <span class="mention person" about="ClintBetts" data-sort="BettsClint" data-label="Clint Betts"url="https://utahvalley360.com/2016/06/09/40-40-clint-betts/"><a href="https://twitter.com/clintbetts">Clint Betts</a></span>, co-founder of the <span class="mention place"about="SiliconSlopes">Silicon Slopes</span> advocacy group, who argues that the success of the local startup scene is largely because <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> is a good place to live.</p>

						<p><span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span> has a low cost of living. It’s clean and safe. The schools are good. It’s got a reliable and affordable public transport system. If you want to start a family, you can easily afford to buy or rent a house. People are friendly. The city is surrounded by gorgeous, rugged countryside.</p>
						
						<figure>
							<img src="imgs\mormons2\img4.jpg">
						</figure>
						
						<p>These factors keep talent within the state, while also attracting skilled developers and entrepreneurs from other major cities.</p>

						<p><span class="mention place" about="SiliconSlopes">Silicon Slopes</span> might not be on everyone’s tongue, but with <span class="mention place" about="SanFrancisco">San Francisco</span>’s housing crisis showing no sign of abating, I wouldn’t be surprised to see <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s relevance increase in the coming years.</p>

						<p><span class="mention person" about="Mark Hofmann">Mark Hofmann</span>’s notorious and deadly legacy will always be inextricably tied to the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span>, but the impact of his machinations spread far outside of <span class="mention place" about="Utah" data-sort="Utah" data-label="Utah" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah">Utah</span> and <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span>. The new documentary about the case, <span class="mention concept" about="MAMA"><cite>Murder Among the Mormons</cite></span>, was one of the most-watched shows on <span class="mention org" about="Netflix">Netflix</span> the week it dropped. The three-part series explores how <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> fooled a nationwide community of scholars, investigators and collectors, the <span class="mention concept" about="bombing" data-sort="bombing" data-label="bombing" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb">bombings</span> that killed two people and, finally, the mistakes he made that led to his capture.</p>

						<p>The documentary makers, <span class="mention person" about="JaredHess" data-sort="HessJared" data-label="Jared Hess" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_and_Jerusha_Hess">Jared Hess</span> (Napoleon Dynamite) and <span class="mention person" about="TylerMeasom" data-sort="MeasomTyler" data-label="Tayler Measom" url="http://www.tylermeasom.com/about">Tyler Measom</span> (An Honest Liar), interviewed former <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span> Historian <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley" data-sort="TurleyRichard" data-label="Richard Turley" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Turley_Jr.">Richard Turley</span> for the true crime series. When I spoke to him following its release <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> described himself as a “fly on the wall” during the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> <span class="mention concept" about="bombing">bombing</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgery</span> investigations. He later wrote a book detailing his observations called <cite><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victims-CHURCH-MARK-HOFMANN-CASE/dp/0252018850">Victims: The <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span> and the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> Case</cite></a>. He wrote it, in part, to address the rampant rumors and speculation about the church’s dealings with <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>.</p> 

						<p>“I basically entered a crime scene,” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said of the time he started working in the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS</span> Church’s history department in 1986, right in the middle of the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> investigation. <q>“The police were looking for a motive for murder.”</q></p>

						<p>The motive became apparent when forensic investigators not only uncovered <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgery</span> of the <span class="mention concept" about="SalamanderLetter" data-sort="SalamanderLetter" data-label="Salamander Letter" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamander_letter">Salamander Letter</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="OathofaFreeman" data-sort="OathofaFreeman" data-label="Oath of a Freeman" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_a_Freeman">Oath of a Freeman</span> but began to realize just how prolific of a <span class="mention concept" about="forgerty">counterfeiter</span> he had been. The turning point came with the so-called <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin Collection</span>—a collection of writings by early Mormon leader <span class="mention person"about="WilliamMcLellin" data-sort="McLellinWilliamE." data-label="William E. McLellin" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._McLellin">William E.

(The <span class="mention concept" about="SalamanderLetter">Salamander Letter</span>, <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forged</span> by <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>, also challenged <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS</span> beliefs—detailing it was a white salamander that led founder <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith" data-sort="SmithJoseph" data-label="Joseph Smith" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith">Joseph Smith</span> to the gold plates, from which he translated the <cite><span class="mention concept" about="Book of Mormon" data-sort="BookofMormon" data-label="Book of Mormon" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon">Book of Mormon</span></cite>, and not an angel.)</p> 

						<p>“He spun this tale of a highly expansive <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin collection</span> with letters from <span class="mention person" about="EmmaSmith" data-sort="SmithEmma" data-label="Emma Smith" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Smith">Emma Smith</span>—<span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Joseph Smith</span>’s wife—and other figures related to the church,” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said. <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> reportedly offered to sell <span class="mention concpet" about="McLellinCollection">the collection</span> to both <span class="mention person" about="AlvinRust" data-sort="RustAlvin" data-label="Alvin Rust" url="https://books.google.it/books/about/Mormon_and_Utah_Coin_and_Currency.html?id=6_nyGAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y">Alvin Rust</span>, a collector of rare coins and other artifacts, as well as <span class="mention person" about="StevenChristensen" data-sort="ChristensenSteven" data-label="Steven Christensen" url="https://heavy.com/news/steven-christensen-steve/">Steven Christensen</span>, a <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity" data-sort="SaltLakeCity" data-label="Salt Lake City" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City">Salt Lake City</span> businessman who had previously bought and donated the <span class="mention concept" about="SalamanderLetter">Salamander Letter to the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span>.</p>

						<p>But <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hoffman</span> ran out of time. “He had created a potential <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgery</span> that was so large, he couldn’t carry it out in the time that he had. That’s when he resorted to <span class="mention concept" about="bombing">bombs</span>,” said <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>. The first <span class="mention concept" about="bombing">bomb</span> exploded on Oct. 15, 1985, in the <span class="mention place" about="JudgeBuilding" data-sort="JudgeBuilding" data-label="Jude Building" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Building_(Salt_Lake_City)">Judge Building</span> in downtown <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span>.

The third <span class="mention concept" about="bombing">bomb</span> blew up <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s own car, along with the unfinished <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgery</span> of the <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin Collection</span> for police to find.</p>

						<p>“When you’re a historian, you’re gathering pieces of a mosaic and putting it on the wall to see what it becomes,” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said. “I think the damage that <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> did—using the mosaic metaphor—was akin to taking a whole dump truck of <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forged pieces</span> and scattering them widely. So the genuine pieces of the past are mixed in with <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">fakes</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgeries</span>.” Those <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgeries</span> make it more difficult to form an accurate picture—or mosaic, if you will—of the past.</p> 

						<p>“<span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgeries</span> will continue to be discovered,” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said. He described a scene at a past annual conference for the <span class="mention org" about="AssociationforDocumentaryEditing" data-sort="AssociationforDocumentaryEditing" data-label="Association for Documentary Editing" url="https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/">Association for Documentary Editing</span> held in <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span>.

At the end of his presentation, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> brought up a sheet of signatures <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forged</span> by <span class="mention person" about="MarkHoffman">Hofmann</span> that was found in his prison mattress. Most of the known <span class="mention person" about="MarkHoffman">Hofmann</span> <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgeries</span> could be tied to one of the signatures on that sheet. “As I mentioned those names,” said <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>, “prominent scholars in the audience began to make exclamations and moans and sighs as they realized this wasn’t just a <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> problem, but a problem for <span class="mention place" about="USA">American</span> and world history generally.”</p>

						<p>Case in point: <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>’s published work on the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHoffman">Hofmann</span> <span class="mention concept" about="bombing">bombings</span> helped one person, in the middle of acquiring an <span class="mention person" about="EmilyDickenson" data-sort="DickensonEmily" data-label="EmilyDickenson" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson">Emily Dickenson</span> piece, discover it to be a <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgery</span> before it was too late. But, because there is no telling how many <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgeries</span> are still out there, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> has a warning for collectors: “Caveat emptor.” Buyer beware.</p> 

						<p>“Better do your homework to figure out whose hands it has passed through and where it came from,” said <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>. “And, if you’re going to spend a lot of money, I’d have a document examiner take a look at it before you buy.”  According to <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>, <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> was not above adding signatures to authentic documents to increase their value. Anything that passed through <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s hands should be suspect.</p> 

					<h2 class="subheading3" id="art3sub2">The secret of <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span>’s (temporary) success</h2>

						<p>Beyond being a talented <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">counterfeiter</span>, <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> knew how to play people. “<span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> held himself out as a bit of a bumbling fool,”explains <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>. “The persona was very deliberate on his part. He just didn’t seem smart enough to create these sophisticated things.”</p> 

						<p><span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> also played on confirmation bias: our tendency to seek out new evidence that confirmed our existing beliefs or theories, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> says. <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> would discover what people hoped to find and, it just so happened, that he might have what they were looking for. <q>“If someone gives you evidence to confirm your existing bias, you accept it uncritically,”</q> explained <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>. “<span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> played off confirmation bias both for and against <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span>.”</p>

						<p>That’s why <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> recommends a healthy dose of skepticism when confronted with any new information or evidence, especially if it confirms our existing bias. Skepticism has saved <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> before. “I have been the victim of people trying to do another <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>, but, due to my experience and skepticism that I have naturally, I’ve been able to stop these schemes before they develop too far.”</p>

						<p>The <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span> has also taken to heart the lessons learned from dealing with <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>. “Basically, what happened before I got to the church historic department, people would acquire materials, put them on the shelf and eventually someone would get around to cataloging them.”</p>

						</figure>

						<p>But, this presented a problem if, in the meantime, the only person who knew a specific piece was in the collection, left the department or passed away. Put simply, <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span> didn’t know what it had, making them easier prey for <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forgers</span> trying to sell fakes of pieces the church possessed. For instance, in the case of <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s collection of <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin writings</span>, a portion of the real writings had been in sitting on a shelf in the church archives all along.</p> 

						<p>So, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> says, <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span> launched a project to catalog everything in the archives. They also instituted a policy that required the archivist who added material to create a corresponding record entry when they brought it in.</p> 

						<p>The church also implemented technology to thwart another of <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s known techniques: going into libraries, shops or archives and removing or adding items or pages from an existing work. Now, the church archives use a highly sensitive scale that can detect such <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">tampering</span>.</p>

						<p>Despite the countermeasures, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> believes that there could always be another <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span>. He referenced <span class="mention person" about="MichaelGeorge" data-sort="GeorgeMichael" data-label="Michael George" url="https://www.deseret.com/2001/3/14/19575178/ex-prosecutor-honored-for-dogged-work">Michael George</span>, the <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCounty"data-sort="SaltLakeCounty" data-label="Salt Lake County" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_County,_Utah">Salt Lake County</span> investigator on the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> case. “When asked, ‘was <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> the greatest <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forger</span> ever?’ <span class="mention person" about="MichaelGeorge">George</span> said, ‘he’s the greatest <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forger ever caught.’”</p>

						<p>While many interviewed for <cite><span class="mention concept" about="MAM">Murder Among the Mormons</span></cite> begrudgingly acknowledged <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s genius, he still made a number of mistakes that led to his inevitable capture. “He got greedy and in over his head,” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> says.</p> 

						<p>There have already been <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> copycats. <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> predicted, “the more people understand about the case and what happened, the more copycats there will be.” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said he writes about the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> copycats he has since encountered in the updated second edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victims-CHURCH-MARK-HOFMANN-CASE/dp/0252018850"><cite>Victims: The <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span></cite></a> and the <cite><span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> Case</cite>, which is available Friday, March 12, 2021. </p>

						<p>While <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> hailed the <span class="mention org" about="Netflix">Netflix</span> documentary as being able to take a “highly complex and esoteric story and portray it in a style that makes it generally accessible to the public,” he does have some reservations about the surge of attention to the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> case. “My big worry is that there is a tendency among some people to lionize criminals and turn them into folk heroes,” said <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>.  “Because <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> displayed a significant amount of skill in <span class="mention concept" about="forgery">forging</span> a broad range of items, there may be some who look at him in a way that may overshadow his psychopathic tendencies. I hope people won’t create a folk hero out of a killer.”</p>
