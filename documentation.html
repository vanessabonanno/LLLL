			  <div class="accordion-body">
				<p>The pre-1800 theme is based on western illuminated manuscripts from 700-1600 C.E. Layouts and styles vary throughout this period based on production location, use, and date. The CSS theme is a hybrid of some of the most distinguishable features of western manuscripts, particularly in Latin, throughout this period.</p>
					
				<h2>Layout</h2>

					<p>The page is laid out in a single unbroken column. I selected a one-column layout for the style because it is very common in medieval manuscripts and easier to read with three articles displayed simultaneously in the website.</p> 

					<p>Text is left-aligned, standard practice in western manuscripts. Although the medieval page is ruled, the text is not justified. I took particular inspiration from the <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2019/10/the-lindisfarne-gospels-turning-over-a-new-leaf.html">Lindisfarne Gospels</a> which do not fill white space at the end of the line and often eschews hyphenation. The text is also inline, with no breaks between paragraphs and even subheadings, as is typical in medieval manuscripts. I have retained punctuation for modern readability.</p>

					<p><a href="https://medievalbooks.nl/2018/09/07/the-architecture-of-the-medieval-page/">Margins vary</a> in manuscripts due to time period, location, use, and other factors. Mathematical principles for page layout and margins were published throughout the period but were not universally adopted. The CSS layout is inspired by a common layout in which the right margin is approximately twice the size of the upper margin, and the lower margin is approximately double the outside. The choice to use no left margin or gutter space is taken from richly illuminated Books of Hours from the high Middle Ages and lack of necessity for page gutters on a webpage.</p>

					<h2>Script</h2>

					<p>The script used is "<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Uncial+Antiqua">Uncial Antiqua</a>" which combines letter forms from <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/ancientbooks/2016/05/25/uncial-half-uncial/">uncial and half uncial</a>. Uncial is a majuscule script commonly used in the early Middle Ages. Closely related to these scripts is insular script (also called insular half-uncial), which originated in Ireland and is used in the <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/library/manuscripts/book-of-kells.php">Book of Kells</a>, the <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2019/09/medieval-sacred-texts-on-display.html">Lindisfarne Gospels</a>, and the <a href="http://www.codex99.com/typography/33.html">Book of Durrow</a>.</p>

					<p>I selected an uncial script because they are relatively easy to read, especially when compared to later Gothic scripts. "Uncial Antiqua" was a faithful digital font  interpretation I found.</p>

					<h2>Color</h2>

					<h3>Text color:</h3> 

					<p>By far the most common color for text is black, followed by red then blue. <a href="https://www.green-coursehub.com/research-blog/illumination-and-rubrication">Rubrication</a> was often used in manuscripts for titles, subtitles,  incipits, explicits and other purposes. The CSS style uses red for subheadings and the selected metadata words.  I chose to make the main titles blue since oftentimes, especially in Bibles, the names of the books are given in blue, red, or some combination plus the medieval page generally has a variety of colors to help the reader navigate the page at a glance. With so much red in the subheadings and metadata selections, I thought a bit of blue would help readers distinguish the title. In both cases, the red and blue used in the CSS is slightly darker than what would be found in a manuscript since the bright red and bright blue were uncomfortable for the eye when lit with the computer screen.</p>

					<h3>Images:</h3> 

					<p>Illuminated manuscripts can have vibrant and varied colors. I used a decorative floral border on the left to recall the thicker, more richly illuminated borders of devotional books of the High Middle Ages. I left the images and videos unfiltered since the digital photographs already had vibrant colors. I added a simple red and blue border since illuminations are often framed and this color scheme is quite common.</p>

Reflection on the nature of time and one's place in the world of God's creation is essential to the experience of an illuminated medieval manuscript.</p>

				<p>This style is inspired by the layouts of posters and magazines published during the Art Nouveau movement. This artistic movement flourished throughout Europe and the United States during the 1890s with maximum diffusion during the last period of the so-called Belle Époque, just before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. It covered almost every art field, from architecture to decorative arts, book illustrations and more. Art Nouveau artists, inspired by plant forms and nature, took organic subjects, and flattened and abstracted them into sophisticated, sinuous, and flowing motifs. Asymmetrical shapes, female forms and exotic woods were also recurrent.</p>

				<p><i>Ver Sacrum</i>, founded by Gustav Klimt and Max Kurzweil in 1898, was the official magazine of the Vienna Secession and redefined the canons of editorial graphics by unifying its elements, including <a href="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2012/04/modern-newspaper-magazine-layouts.html#Six">advertisements</a>.</p>

				<h2>Layout</h2>

				<p><i>Ver Sacrum</i> utilised a <a href="https://www.theviennasecession.com/ver-sacrum/">unique square format</a> which offered new possibilities in layout for the designer’s use of multiple text columns and decorative borders. <i>Ver Sacrum</i> in its publications uses a <a href="https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/vs1898/0009">double-column</a> as well as <a href="https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/vs1902/0057">one-column</a> layout: I opted for a single column to guarantee to the user a good readability while the three articles are displayed at once.</p>

				<p>The alignment of the text is justified, the first letter of the first paragraph is usually decorated while the first line is indented. Though at the beginning they opted for capital letters decorated with natural hornaments or humans in nature (see picture below) in some paragraphs of the magazines, from 1900 on they decided for a capital letter without peculiar decorations. You can see the font that inspired my choice below. At first I opted for a floral capital letter; then I decided to use a simpler option for the capital letter in order to represent better the style <i>Ver Sacrum</i> had at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
					
				<div class="row justify-content-center">

					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Due to its square format, <i>Ver Sacrum</i> margins were very wide. I decided to not use a very large value for the margins of the elements inside the articles’ containers since the space in the viewport is quite limited, anyway it can be notices that the margins of “Art Nouveau” CSS style are bigger than the ones of the other styles.</p>
				<p>Sometimes, to fill the page, some patterns were placed right below the ending of the last paragraph. In the Art Nouveau stylesheet you can find some figures at the end of each metadata and article column. Also, for the quotes, a little decoration was added before and after the text, to recall the idea of filling empty lines or spaces with something artistic. An example is visible in the second article of <i>Pets</i>.</p>

				<h2>Script</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/edda-font.html">Edda</a> is the font used for titles, subtitles (inspired by the figures below) and for the starting capital letters. Art Nouveau magazines normally chose serif fonts for the paragraphs, as to follow the synuosity of the natural decorations: <a href="https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/download/e307195432f00bcd92a324df9ae723a5">Tarocco Roman</a> – a serif script – was selected for the paragraphs. At that time sans serif fonts existed but were not widely used. Only later, in 1920, the <a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/the-rise-of-the-sans-serif--cms-33548">Bauhaus popularised sans serif</a> as a reaction to the embellished Art Nouveau style.</p>
				<p>Edda seemed perfect for the titles since it immediately recalls the Art Nouveau style. Before I experimented with <a href="https://www.wfonts.com/font/liberty">Liberty</a> font for the titles (a similar font was used in the Italian magazine <a href="https://emporium.sns.it/galleria/libro.php?volume=VI&pagina=VI_034_240_0.jpg">Emporium</a>) but it did not represent the style as well as Edda in my opinion.  </p>

				<h2>Images and colours</h2>
				<p> <i>Ver Sacrum</i> and other Art Nouveau magazines contain different kind of art: pictorial art, as decorations, drawings and sketches and more - not only black and white - and photographs - mostly black and white. For the multimedia content of the articles I decided to add a black and white filter in order to mime how <i>Ver Sacrum</i> attached photographs in their magazines.</p>

				<p>Figure captions were typically placed near the image in a limited space, as you can see in the example below. This solution was chosen even for the Art Nouveau stylesheet in this online magazine, but, instead of placing the caption on the side of the image, it was preferred to leave it under the figure, in order to keep a decent size for the picture and to mantain a readable font size for the caption.</p>

				</div>
				
				<p>The colours used in <i>Ver Sacrum</i> magazine are few, and mostly used in the decorations, sketches or for some titles. Art Nouveau posters are known for their warm colours, such as different shades of orange, yellow and pale pink. Art Nouveau artists used colours wisely, combining the main color with its respective secondary color, or with others to find a perfect harmony, as can be noticed in the Mucha's decorative patterns and litography above. For the colours of the CSS style I decided to use different shades of khaki yellow and pale pink, to match the two decorations used in the background. The links in the page are pale pink too.</p>

			  <div class="accordion-body">
				<p>This theme is inspired by mass-market print publications of the 1960s. Specific inspiration was taken from <a href="https://fact.110west40th.com/"><cite>Fact</cite></a>, an American quarterly published January 1964 to August 1967 and the West German magazine <a href="http://www.magazinedesigning.com/twen-the-most-influential-magazine-of-all-times/"><cite>Twen</cite></a>, published 1959 to 1970 under <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/willy-fleckhaus-design-rainbow-revolt-graphic-design-180717">Willy Fleckhaus</a>.</p>

				<h2>Layout</h2>

					<p>Although multiple columns were common in publications from this period, given the length of these texts I chose to use only one column per article for ease of readability. I wanted to capture the spirit of very graphic, modern, and eye-catching designs and saw that the more youthful, innovative, and controversial magazines <cite>Twen</cite> and <cite>Fact</cite> used a single-column layout more often than more traditional publications from that period.</p>

					</div>

					<p>The border around each article is inspired by the covers of <cite>Twen</cite>. I adapted the solid black-border motif by making the right side thicker to give it more visual interest since the columns all look very similar and I wanted to make it more visually striking and exciting.</p>

					<p>Body text is justified as it is in all my source examples. There is no space between paragraphs but rather an ident, as was typical in the examples. There is a relatively small space between the text block and the border since there is clear whitespace between columns in the sources but the margins are relatively small. There is enough whitespace to make it easier to read, but not too much as to waste space. Even <cite>Twen</cite> which often uses white space to graphic effect usually fills almost the entire column width with text, leaving just enough whitespace to keep the text legible and the column organization apparent.</p>

			<h2>Fonts:</h2> 

				<h3>Body text: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Caslon+Text" style="font-family: 'Libre Caslon Text'"> Libre Caslon Text</a></h3>

					<p>Libre Caslon Text is in the same family as </a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/16766/fact-magazine-covers"><cite>Fact</cite>'s main cover font</a>, Caslon No. 471. As far as the Caslon family of fonts goes, I chose Libre Caslon Text also because it is based on Caslon fonts as reinterpreted for use in 1950s advertising rather than the original 18th-century fonts.</p>

				<h3>Headlines: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plaster" style="font-family: Plaster">Plaster</a></h3>

					<p>Plaster is based on the work of abstract painter and typographer <a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/josef-albers/">Josef Albers (1888 - 1976)</a> and was selected for this project due to its similarity to one of the fonts in <cite>Twen</cite>.</p>

				<h3>Subtitles: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous" style="font-family: Righteous">Righteous</a></h3>

					<p>I chose Righteous to use in conjunction with Plaster because, like Plaster, it is a sans serif with rounded letter forms. It is easier to read in long stretches.</p>

				<h3>Figure Captions: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Teko" style="font-family: Teko">Teko</a></h3>

					<p>Figure captions are in Teko, a modern sans serif font. I chose Teko because of its square proportions and sharp lines. It is similar to Righteous and Plaster in its geometric design, but its sharper, squarer shapes provide the distinction between title, body text, and captions necessary in this period.</p>

					<p>Additionally, from my examples of this time period, I saw that in most cases when the body text was in a serif font, the captions were sans serif. Italics were also frequently used for captions in this period, but I felt they did not match the modern spirit of the overall design and title fonts so I went with the sans serif.</p>

				<h3>Emphasis: Font choice and <b>bold</b></h3>

					<p>Emphasis is added through font choice, which distinguishes headlines, captions, and body text from one another. When searching the texts for metadata, emphasis is given to search terms through bolding à la <cite>Fact</cite>. I used a shadow in CSS to make it extra bold since a weight of 1000 wasn't quite bold enough, especially in a theme already using black in strong visual ways.</p>

			<h2>Figures</h2>

				<p>This theme sticks to rectangular, borderless images, a recurring style for photography in publications of the period. This was not unique to cutting-edge publications but appears in local newspapers, instructional manuals, educational booklets and a wide variety of other publication types.</p>

				<p>I have given all images and videos a black and white filter to recall mass print in this period and as an homage to <cite>Fact</cite> and <cite>Twen</cite>'s use of black and white not simply for cost but as an essential element in the design aesthetic. Plus, it references the prevalence of black and white in mid-century modern beyond the printed page.</p>

			<h2>Scrolling</h2>

			<p>The scroll bar is hidden. I didn't want there to be any scroll bar because there were no scroll bars in mid-century print publications. The right border is thicker to add visual interest but it is not a scrollbar. I chose to make it a border so that it looked better across a variety of browsers.</p>

			<p>The scroll is a hard jump when accessing subtitles to mimic a macro-scanning through a page turn. It is smooth when scrolling through the text to help the eye scan the material normally as it would in a print magazine.</p>

				<strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element.

It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

			    <h2>Layout</h2>
				<p>Futuristic style is inspired by an ideal world in which nature wins. Technologies and nature coexist in a harmonious world where the human being learnt to preserve natural landscapes, even with the digital applications and software’s help. The idea of the two worlds (human-dependent technologies and wild nature) in a reciprocal relationship of coexistence is represented by the overlapping of different columns containing the articles to a majestic uncontaminated natural environment (Norwegian fjords).</p>
				
				<div class="row justify-content-center">					
					<div class="card mx-2 mt-2" style="width: 18rem;">
					  <img class="card-img-top" src="doc/future/img14.jpg"  alt="">
					  <div class="card-body">
						<p class="card-text">This was another option for the background.</p>
					  </div>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<p>The overlapping elements are almost transparent to let the user appreciate the view: will the next decade’s generations be able to appreciate such natural landscapes in the real world? The 2030 style will not answer to this question, leaving it open to reflect on it.</p>
				<p>The user of the future will probably read and compare the articles through hololenses, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihick-4aLw0&t=3s">mixed reality</a>. The imaginary device understands and reads the user’s eye movement and follows it, so once it understands the user is looking at a certain article, it activates, this means it is no more transparent, but its content is revealed. This should facilitate the 2030 users to keep concentrate and focused, erasing possibly distracting content from the sight. If the device understands the user needs to read from the three articles at the same time in order to confront some specific parts, the transparency is deactivated to let him compare them (this is an imaginary feature, not implemented in the prototype).</p>
				<p>The animation added to the images (zoom) mimes a feature I believe could be interesting for future applications: ideally, the image the user is staring at opens in order to let him inspect it better. Obviously, this could also be working through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesture_recognition">gesture recognition technology</a>.</p>
				
				<h2>Fonts</h2>
				<p>Minimalism and simplicity are keys of this style. The fonts used are all sans serif as, in my opinion, serif fonts will not be used in 2030 as designers will opt for easy-to-read and clean writings.</p>
				
				<div class="row justify-content-center">
					<div class="card mx-2 mt-2" style="width: 18rem;">
					  <img class="card-img-top" src="doc/future/img12.jpg"  alt="">
					  <div class="card-body">
						<p class="card-text">This was another option for the title font.</p>
					  </div>
					</div>

					  <div class="card-body">
						<p class="card-text"> Style I used as reference for the futuristic CSS.</p>
					  </div>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<h2>Colours</h2>
				<p>The colours chosen for the columns of the articles belong to the same colour palette of the image used in the background. I decided to not use high contrasts in the layout of the page to not strain the eyes and I opted for a grey text over dark background for the same reason. The titles and the links are brighter to capture the attention of the reader. Also the filter for images is specifically created to desaturate them in order to let them display harmoniously with the background and not strain the eyes.</p>  
				
				<div class="row justify-content-center">
					<div class="card mx-2 mt-2" style="width: 18rem;">
					  <img class="card-img-top" src="doc/future/palette1.png"  alt="palette1 Phthalo Green">

					  <div class="card-body">
						<p class="card-text"></p>
					  </div>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<h2>Accessibility</h2>
				<p>Also, the text inside of the paragraphs is aligned on the left and not justified, because the justification could cause some reading <a href="https://uxmovement.com/content/6-surprising-bad-practices-that-hurt-dyslexic-users/">problems to people affected by dyslexia</a>, as it creates large uneven spaces between letters and words.</p>
				
				<p>About accessibility, I think audible content will become more and more frequent and normal in the future, as a way to become inclusive towards visually impaired and blind users. The 2030 magazine should provide audio versions of each article, so that the user can autonomously choose. Also the documentation section will have to be audible in order to explain to the visually impaired user every aspect of the visual content and the choices behind of it. <a href="https://www.gearbrain.com/microsoft-hololens-helps-blind-people-2573575574.html">Very interesting studies</a> about the possibilities of hololenses and similar technologies already exist, and I think that in less than 10 years, <i>accessibility</i> will be characterised by the advent of increasingly innovative studies that will also help disadvantaged people to be fully part of the technological world.</p>
