						<p>The <span class="mention org" about="LDS" data-sort="LDS" data-label="Church of Jessus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span> has <a class="test" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/439385879/Letter-to-an-IRS-Director">allegedly amassed US$100 billion in purportedly charitable assets</a> since 1997 without ever giving any money away – a possible breach of federal <span class="mention concept" about="tax" data-sort="tax" data-label="tax">tax</span> laws.</p>

						<p>This estimate of the size of its investment vehicle known as <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors" data-sort="EnsignPeakAdvisors" data-label="Ensign Peak Advisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> became public knowledge when <span class="mention person" about"DavidNielsen" data-sort"NielsenDavid" data-label="David A. Niesen">David A. Nielsen</span>, a former employee and a member of <span class="mention org" about="LDS">the church</span>, blew the whistle.</p>

						<p>Together with his <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mormons-heres-why-we-published-our-revelations-about-lds-churchs-100-billion-stockpile-1478084">twin brother <span class="mention person" about="LarsNielsen" data-sort="NielsenLars" data-label="Lars Nielsen">Lars</span></a>, a former church member, <span class="mention person" about="DavidNielsen">Nielsen</span> gave the <span class="mention org" about="IRS" data-sort="IRS" data-label="International Revenue Service">Internal Revenue Service</span> evidence he claims proves <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/mormon-church-has-misled-members-on-100-billion-tax-exempt-investment-fund-whistleblower-alleges/2019/12/16/e3619bd2-2004-11ea-86f3-3b5019d451db_story.html">the church mishandled funds</a>.</p>

						<p>According to the <span class="mention person" about="DavidNielsen"><span class="mention person" about="LarsNielsen">Nielsens</span></span>, <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> has invested the church’s annual surplus member contributions to build up a $100 billion portfolio. But the Nielsens say they could find no evidence that <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> spent a dime of this money for religious, charitable, educational or other “public” purposes as <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.501(c)(3)-1"><span class="mention org" about="IRS">IRS</span> rules require under most circumstances</a>. They also allege that it diverted <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span>-exempt funds to finance some for-profit projects, which could also violate <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/326/279/"><span class="mention org" about="IRS">IRS</span> rules banning such transactions</a> in some situations.</p>

						<p>If the <span class="mention org" about="IRS">IRS</span> determines that the investment fund failed to act as a charity even though it benefited from <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span> breaks, it might find that <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> <a href="https://bycommonconsent.com/2019/12/17/some-thoughts-about-ensign-peak-advisers-and-the-church/">broke <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span> laws</a>.

						<p>If the numbers are accurate, <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign</span> is the nation’s largest charitable endowment, with as much money as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/081616/top-5-largest-university-endowments.asp"><span class="mention org" about="Harvard" data-sort="Harvard" data-label="Harvard University">Harvard University</span></a> and the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/foundation-fact-sheet"><span class="mention org" about="GatesFoundation" data-sort="GatesFoundation" data-label="Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</span></a> have at their disposal, combined, if not more.</p>

						<p>Church leaders <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-statement-church-finances">deny that they have violated</a> any laws that regulate <span class="mention concept" about="tax" data-sort="tax" data-label="tax">tax</span>-exempt institutions. <span class="mention org" about="LDS">The church</span> “complies with all applicable law governing our donations, investments, <span class="mention concept" about="tax">taxes</span> and reserves,” said the <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/12/17/lds-church-we-obey-all/">three-member council</a> headed by church president <span class="mention person" about="RussellNelson" data-sort="NelsonRussell" data-label="Russell M.

						<p>From my vantage point as a <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737433">historian of Mormonism</a>, this news marks a new twist on an old story. For nearly two centuries, the church has conducted its finances in ways that defy the expectations Americans have for religious organizations.</p>

					<h2>A church-owned ‘anti-bank’</h2>

						<p>Consider what happened in the <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/articles/joseph-smith-and-his-papers-an-introduction">summer of 1837</a>, when the fledgling church teetered on the brink of collapse.</p>

						<p>At the time, <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith" data-sort="SmithJoseph" data-label="Joseph Smith">Joseph Smith</span> and many church members lived in <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland" data-sort="Kirtland" data-label="Kirtland">Kirtland</span>, a small town in northeastern <span class="mention place" about="Ohio" data-sort="Ohio" data-label="Ohio">Ohio</span>. The Smith family had moved there in the early 1830s, seeking a safer gathering place for church members in the face of persecution in <span class="mention place" about="NY" data-sort="NY" data-label="New York">New York state</span>.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="imgs\mormons1\img2.jpg">
							<figcaption><span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Joseph Smith</span>’s followers built this temple in <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Ohio">Ohio</span> before most of them moved westward. <span class="credit"><span class="mention org" about="LOC" data-sort="LOC" data-label="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</span></span></figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p><span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Smith</span> and his followers began building a <a href="https://www.kirtlandtemple.org/">temple in <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span></a>. <span class="mention org" about="LDS">The Saints</span> dedicated their temple in 1836, but the project left <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Smith</span> and others deep in debt. Like many communities in antebellum <span class="mention place" about="USA" data-sort="USA" data-label="United States">America</span>, <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> was land-rich and cash-poor. A lack of hard currency hampered commerce.</p>

						<p><span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Smith</span> and his associates <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/kirtland-safety-society?lang=eng">decided to start their own bank</a> to solve their financial woes. The circulation of bank notes, they thought, would boost <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span>’s economic prospects and make it easier for church leaders to satisfy their creditors.</p>

					<h2>Lots of currency</h2>

						<p>The idea of <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> leaders printing their own money wasn’t as crazy as it sounds in 2019. The <span class="mention place" about="USA">United States</span> <a href="http://numismatics.org/a-history-of-american-currency/">still lacked a uniform currency</a>. A host of institutions of varying integrity – chartered banks, unchartered banks, other businesses and even <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674032446">counterfeiting rings</a> – issued notes whose acceptance depended on the confidence of citizens who might accept or refuse them.</p>

						<p><span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> leaders bought engraving plates for printing bank notes and asked the <span class="mention org" about="Ohiostatelegislature" data-sort="Ohiostatelegislature" data-label="Ohio State Legislature"><span class="mention place" about="Ohio">Ohio</span> state legislature</span> to charter their bank. The <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> proposal went <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674032446">nowhere in the legislature</a>.</p>

						<figure>

Pizac">Douglas C. Pizac</span></span></figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>At this point, church leaders took a more fateful and dubious step.</p>

						<p>They had collected money from investors and had already begun printing notes of the “<a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_835201"><span class="mention org" about="KirtlandSafetySocietyBank" data-sort="KirtlandSafetySocietyBank" data-label="Kirtland Safety Society Bank"><span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> Safety Society Bank</span></a>.” Instead of shutting down the operation when the charter failed to come through, they doubled down. Worried about the legal risk of running an unchartered bank, church leaders altered the notes to read “anti-Banking-Co.”</p>

					<h2>A brief boom</h2>
					
						<p>For a while, all went well. “<span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> bills are as safe as gold,” <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674416857">one church member wrote</a> in January 1837. The town enjoyed a short-lived boom.</p>

						<p>Soon, however, the anti-bank proved anything but safe. Non-Mormons questioned the society’s ability to redeem its notes, and church leaders could not keep it afloat. The <span class="mention org" about="KirtlandSafetySocietyBank"><span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> Safety Society</span>’s struggles were not unusual. Scores of banks, including some of the nation’s largest, failed in what became the <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801478864/americas-first-great-depression/">Panic of 1837</a>. Real estate speculators lost their fortunes, and workers lost their jobs.</p>

						<p>What made <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span> different was the bank’s ownership. Many church members lost not only confidence in the society’s banknotes, but faith in the prophet who had signed them.</p>

						<p>The crisis divided the church. At one point that summer, church members wielding pistols and bowie knives fought with each other in the temple. <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Smith</span> and one of his top associates were <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/topic/kirtland-safety-society">convicted of issuing banknotes without a charter</a> and fined $1,000 each. They soon fled the courts and their creditors, taking refuge with fellow church members in Missouri.</p>

						<p>After anti-<span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> mobs forced the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">Latter-day Saints</span> out of <span class="mention place" about="Missouri" data-sort="Missouri" data-label="Missouri">Missouri</span> and then <span class="mention place" about="Illinois" data-sort="Illinoise" data-label="Illinois">Illinois</span>, <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Smith</span>’s successor, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/religion/brigham-young"><span class="mention person" about="BrighamYoung" data-sort="YoungBrigham" data-label="Birgham Young">Brigham Young</span></a>, led thousands of church members to what became the <span class="mention place" about="Utah" data-sort="Utah" data-label="Utah">Utah Territory</span>.</p>

					<h2>From a railroad to a shopping mall</h2>
						<p>The church has never stopped blending commerce and religion.</p>

						<p>In the late 1860s, <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormons</span> built the <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469653204/railroading-religion/">Utah Central Railroad</a>, which connected <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity" data-sort="SaltLakeCity" data-label="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</span> with <span class="mention place" about="Ogden" data-sort="Ogden" data-label="Ogden">Ogden</span> – a stop along the transcontinental railroad. Church leaders controlled the railway until 1878, when <a href="https://utahrails.net/utahrails/uc-rr-1869-1881.php"><span class="mention org" about="UnionPacific" data-sort="UnionPacific" data-label="Union Pacific">Union Pacific</span></a> bought it.</p>

						<p>Beginning in 1868, the church also operated the <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=4083139&itype=CMSID"><span class="mention org" about="ZionsCooperativeMecantileInstitution" data-sort="ZionsCooperativeMecantileInstitution" data-label="Zion's Cooperative Mecantile Institution"> Zion’s Cooperative Mercantile Institution<span></a>, a department store designed to put the squeeze on non-<span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> businesses.</p>

						<p>The church sold the store in 1999, but in many ways its commercial interests have become more grandiose since its frontier days of railroading and retailing.</p>

						<p>In 2003, the church’s for-profit real estate division purchased the land on which the store had stood. Nine years later, the estimated $1.5 billion <a href="https://archive.curbed.com/2018/3/20/17142760/salt-lake-city-downtown-development-hot-market"><span class="mention place"about="CityCreekCenter" data-sort="CityCreekCenter" data-label="City Creek Center">City Creek Center</span></a> development opened to the public, including a glitzy mall.</p>

						</figure>

						<p>At the time, <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=54478720&itype=cmsid">church officials asserted</a> that they had not used any tithing money on the <span class="mention place"about="CityCreekCenter">City Creek</span> project. The <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/tithing-and-fast-offerings/how-are-tithing-funds-used?lang=eng">church explains</a> that tithing – the contribution of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/mormon/customs/tithing.shtml">10%</a> of its <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/2018-statistical-report-released-during-april-2019-general-conference?lang=eng">16 million members’</a> annual income – is for the construction and maintenance of church buildings, local congregational activities and the church’s educational programs. The church’s <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=54478720&itype=cmsid">for-profit divisions</a> handle commercial projects, including real estate and publishing.</p>

						<p>The <span class="mention person" about="DavidNielsen"><span class="mention person" about="LarsNielsen">Nielsen brothers</span></span> allege that <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mormon-church-stockpiled-100-billion-intended-charities-misled-lds-members-whistleblower-says-1477809">diverted  $1.4 billion in tithing funds</a> to pay for the development, a possible violation of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations"><span class="mention org" about="IRS">IRS</span> rules that govern <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span>-exempt institutions</a>.</p>

						<p>It is impossible to confirm the accusation without greater transparency on the part of the church, which has told <a href="https://religionunplugged.com/news/2019/12/16/whistleblower-exposes-100-billion-stockpile-by-mormon-church"><span class="mention org" about="ReligionUnplugged" data-sort="ReligionUnplugged" data-label="Religion Unplugged">Religion Unplugged</span></a>, a nonprofit media outlet, that it “does not provide information about specific transactions or financial decisions.”</p>

						<p>According to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ef2n0uEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"><span class="mention person" about="SamuelBurnson" data-sort="BrunsonSamuel" data-label="Samuel Brunson">Samuel Brunson<span></a>, a <span class="mention concept" about="tax">tax</span> law professor, the church was <a href="https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Mormonism_and_church_finances/Twenty-first_century/Disclosure">more open</a> about its ledger sheet and business arrangements during the first half of the 20th century.</p>

						<p>Then, in the mid- to late 1950s, it <a href="https://sunstone.org/pdf/102-17-29.pdf">lost approximately $10 million</a> in municipal bond investments. The resulting embarrassment was one factor in the church’s decision to become less forthcoming about its finances.</p>

						<p>In this respect, the church is not unique. <span class="mention place" about="USA">U.S.</span> laws do not require churches to disclose their financial information in much detail. While some churches do so voluntarily, others – including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/07/17/facing-financial-boycott-west-virginias-catholic-diocese-agrees-hire-new-auditor-make-findings-public/"><span class="mention org" about="CatholicChurch" data-sort="CatholicChurch" data-label="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</span></a> – keep their financial and commercial interests <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/how-rich-is-the-catholic-church-it-s-impossible-to-tell-13295788">shrouded from public view</a>.</p>

					<h2>Saving for a ‘rainy decade’</h2>
					
						<p>It remains to be seen whether <span class="mention org" about="EnsignPeakAdvisors">Ensign Peak Advisors</span> is going to become the subject of <span class="mention org" about="IRS">IRS</span> investigations.</p>

						<p>There are, of course, ethical and moral questions in addition to legal ones. For example, should the church amass so much money? And might the church use more of its excess funds and investment gains for humanitarian purposes or to make the tuition at church-owned <a href="https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-tuition-increase-three-percent-2019-2020-academic-year"><span class="mention org" about="BYU" data-sort="BYU" data-label="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young University</span></a> even more affordable?</p>

						<p>What’s also at stake is confidence in the church’s leaders. <span class="mention person" about="MittRomney" data-sort="RomneyMitt" data-label="Mitt Romney">Sen. Mitt Romney</span>, the <span class="mention org" about="RepublicanParty" data-sort-"RepublicanParty" data-label="Republican Party">Republican Party</span>’s 2012 presidential nominee and the nation’s most politically influential Mormon, <a href="https://twitter.com/thomaswburr/status/1207021336721268736?s=20">professed to be</a> “happy that they’ve not only saved for a rainy day, but for a rainy decade.”</p>

						<p><span class="mention person" about="MittRomney">Romney</span>’s perspective makes some historical sense, given that the most obvious problem in <span class="mention place" about="Kirtland">Kirtland</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Ohio">Ohio</span>, was that <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Joseph Smith<span>’s financial stewardship was decidedly unwise.

						<p><span class="mention place" about="TempleSquare" data-sort="TempleSquare" data-label="Temple Square">Temple Square</span> sits at the heart of <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity" data-sort="SaltLakeCity" data-label="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</span>’s downtown. The ten-acre complex is the closest thing to the <span class="mention place"about="Vatican" data-sort="Vatican" data-label="Vatican City">Vatican City</span> for the <span class="mention org" about="LDS" data-sort="LDS" data-label="Church of Jessus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Latter-Day Saint</span> (LDS) faith. Within its lush surroundings, it houses the world’s most prominent Mormon temple. Visitors are welcome to visit the grounds, and as you walk through the immaculately groomed facility, you’ll inevitably catch the eye of a young missionary.</p>

						<p><span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism" data-sort="Mormonism" data-label="Mormonism">Mormonism</span> is a famously proselytizing faith. A common rite of passage for young Mormon men (and women, albeit to a lesser extent) is to embark upon a mission, where they dedicate as much as two years of their life to spread their faith, often thousands of miles from home. But what happens when their mission ends and they return to secular life?</p>

						<p>In many cases, they’re finding success in <span class="mention place" about="Utah" data-sort="Utah" data-label="Utah">Utah</span>’s burgeoning technology sector, either working on the front-line of sales or software development, or even founding innovative companies themselves. Indeed, one could even make a compelling case that returned LDS missionaries are the “secret sauce” behind the frenetic growth of the <span class="mention place" about="SiliconSlopes" data-sort="SiliconSlopes" data-label="Silicon Slopes">Silicon Slopes</span> scene.</p>

					<h2>The <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> Success Story</h2>

						<p>“<span class="mention place" about="SiliconSlopes">Silicon Slopes</span>” refers to two things; the first is a geographical area that encompasses <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span> and many of the surrounding towns, including <span class="mention place" about="Lehi" data-sort="Lehi" data-label="Lehi">Lehi</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Provo" data-sort="Provo" data-label="Provo">Provo</span>, and <span class="mention place" about="Orem" data-sort="Orem" data-label="Orem">Orem</span>. The second is a <a href="https://siliconslopes.com/">501(c) non-profit organization</a> that advocates for technology companies in this area.</p>

						<p>Outside of the state, <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> isn’t especially well-known for its startup scene. It’s undeniably overshadowed by <span class="mention place" about="SanFrancisco" data-sort="SanFrancisco" data-label="San Francisco">San Francisco</span> and <span class="mention place" about="NewYorkCity" data-sort="NewYorkCity" data-label="New York City">New York</span>, both of which house most of <span class="mention place" about="America" data-sort="America" data-label="America">America</span>’s leading technology companies. These two cities attract the lion’s share of venture capital money, and therefore command most of the media attention.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="imgs\mormons2\img2.jpg">
						</figure>

						<p>Despite that relative obscurity, <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> has produced some astounding success stories. The most well-known is arguably the <span class="mention place" about="Farmington" data-sort="Farmington" data-label="Farmington">Farmington</span>-based <span class="mention org" about="Pluralsight" data-sort="Pluralsight" data-label="Pluralsight"><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a></span>, which runs a training platform designed for technology professionals. Last year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/pluralsight-ps-ipo-stock-starts-trading-on-nasdaq.html">it went public</a>, raising $310.5 million and cementing the company’s rightful place in “unicorn” territory.</p>

						<p>Beyond <span class="mention org" about="Pluralsight">Pluralsight</span>, there’s at least three other unicorn-level technology companies operating within the state of <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>. The customer experience firm <span class="mention org" about="Qualtrics" data-sort="Qualtrics" data-label="Qualtrics"><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a></span>, for example, was acquired by <span class="mention org" about="SAP" data-sort="SAP" data-label="SAP">SAP</span> in 2018 <a href="https://news.sap.com/2019/01/sap-completes-qualtrics-acquisition/">for a cool $8 billion</a>. Another startup, <span class="mention org" about="Domo" data-sort="Domo" data-label="Domo">Domo</span>, creates cloud analytics software and was valued at $2 billion when it went public last year. <span class="mention org" about="InsideSales" data-sort="InsideSales" data-label="InsideSales"><a href="https://www.InsideSales.com">InsideSales</a></span> is also believed to be worth over a billion dollars, although the precise figure isn’t exactly known.</p>

						<p>But if you really want to measure the success of <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s startup scene, you don’t need to read <span class="mention org" about="TechCrunch" data-sort="TechCrunch" data-label="TechCrunch">TechCrunch</span> or <span class="mention org" data-sort="WallStreetJournal" data-label="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</span>. You just need to fly to <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span> and look out of your window as the plane makes its descent. The picturesque mountains that surround the state’s capital are quite pockmarked with massive, high-tech office buildings that house an army of developers and assorted technologists. And a great many of these workers are returned missionaries.</p>

					<h2>The Missionary Life</h2>
					
						<p>It’s entirely possible you’ve encountered a <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> missionary before. They might have stopped you in the street or knocked on your door. Perhaps you’ve even invited one into your home to perform a bible reading, or so you can ask more probing questions about the faith. But most of us don’t actually know what the day-to-day life of a smartly dressed <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> missionary is like.</p>

						<p>Suffice to say, it’s a remarkable departure from everyday life. As one missionary I spoke to in <span class="mention place" about="TempleSquare">Temple Square</span> explained, it’s a life of discipline and ascetism, where choices are made on your behalf by other senior officials in the church. When you put on your suit and name badge, you effectively relinquish your free will.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="imgs\mormons2\img3.jpg">
						</figure>

						<p>Missionaries get no choice of where they serve, nor who they serve with. They are always supposed to remain within reach of their companions, except for when using the shower or restroom. Privacy simply isn’t a thing.</p>

						<p>Six days a week, <span class="mention org" about="LDS" data-sort="LDS" data-label="Church of Jessus Christ of Latter-day Saints">LDS</span> missionaries perform their duties. On their sole day off, they’re allowed to email or write (and, as of February this year, call) home. They are commanded to refrain from secular entertainment. They avoid popular music, instead listening to hymns or EFYs (which stands for “especially for youth,” and is a subgenre of contemporary music that’s firmly rooted in <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> theology).</p>

						<p>And crucially, missionaries need an unbelievably thick skin. They routinely deal with rejection. Sometimes this is manifested in a polite “no.” Sometimes it isn’t. Faith, after all, is perhaps the most personal thing there is.</p>

					<h2>Heading to the slopes</h2>
					
						<p>After a young <span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormon</span> concludes their mission, they began their return into secular life. Having discharged their solemn duties to their church and their God, they’re able to pursue more worldly goals, like family, education, and a career.</p>

						<p>And inevitably, many find their way into local technology companies, where they become a valuable resource. As <span class="mention org" about="Pluralsight">Pluralsight</span> CEO <span class="mention person" about="Aaron Skonnard" data-sort="SkonnardAaron" data-label="AaronSkonnard"><a href="https://twitter.com/skonnard">Aaron Skonnard</a></span> explained, much of this value derives from the experiences and skills gained during missions.</p>

						<p>“I do think there’s something transformative about that experience that produces leadership qualities, selling skills, and high EQ [emotional quotient],” he told me.</p>

						<p>“It’s an incubator for those skills, because you’ve got to live with people you’ve never met before. You’re assigned a companion who you’re with 24/7 until you get changed. And you’re constantly being rotated between different companions – which you have no choice or input into. And then you go out and sell the hardest thing it is to sell, which is religion.”</p>

						<p>Religion isn’t just deeply personal. To the faithful, it’s the fundamental basis of how they understand the world. Scripture provides a rulebook for life, and addresses the questions of “where did I come from” and “where will I go?” As <span class="mention person" about="AaronSkonnard">Skonnard</span> points out, talking about this with absolute strangers requires a level of emotional intelligence.</p>

						<p>“Being a missionary requires a deep ability to relate with people. To understand what their motivations are, where they are in their lives, and why they’d consider making a change of something as big as their religion. In that whole process you make those whole EQ sills, and learn how to ‘close the deal’,” <span class="mention person" about="AaronSkonnard">Skonnard said.</p>

						<p>This is arguably why <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s economy (and not merely the technology sector) is heavily dominated by sales companies. This culture, plus a cheap and youthful labor pool, has attracted large blue-chip companies like <span class="mention org" about="HomeDepot" data-sort="HomeDepot" data-label="HomeDepot">Home Depot</span> and <span class="mention org" data-sort="Esurance" data-label="Esurance">Esurance</span> to <a href="https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html">open call centers within the state</a>.</p>

						<p><span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> is also the birthplace of countless multi-level marketing (MLM) companies, the top nine of which collectively earned $7.6 billion in revenue during 2017 alone. This proliferation of questionable network marketing schemes has resulted in a cruel joke that states the acronym “MLM” actually stands for “<span class="mention concept" about="Mormonism">Mormons</span> losing money.”</p>

						<p>And then there’s the language factor. Although the LDS faith originated in the <span class="mention place" about="USA" data-sort="USA" data-label="United States">United States</span>, it’s since spread globally, with missionaries working across the world. One missionary told me about a friend who was transplanted from <span class="mention place" data-sort="Australia" data-label="Australia">Australia</span> to <span class="mention place" about="HongKong" data-sort="HongKong" data-label="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</span>, and therefore had to learn Cantonese. Another former missionary, 2012 presidential candidate <span class="mention person" about="MittRomney" data-sort="RomneyMitt" data-label="Mitt Romney">Mitt Romney</span>, speaks fluent French thanks to his time in Paris.</p>

						</figure>
						
						<p><span>Missionaries carry these language skills into later life, making them even more valuable to <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s technology companies, which are increasingly outward looking.</span></p>

					<h2>More than just missionaries</h2>
					
						<p>Of course, <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s recent technological success is the product of several factors, with the prevalence of former missionaries being just one. It benefits from several highly regarded universities, all with excellent Computer Science programs that pump out talented (<a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-1-university-in-the-u-s-for-spinning-off-startups-may-surprise-you">and often entrepreneurial</a>) developers.</p>

						<p>There’s also an important cultural factor. <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s companies are more conservative than their Californian counterparts. VC capital is comparatively harder to obtain than in <span class="mention place" about="SiliconValley" data-sort="SiliconValley" data-label="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</span>, so companies must achieve profitability early. This creates companies that are ultimately more sustainable, and based on long-term aspirations.</p>

						<p>And maybe it’s <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> itself.</p>
				
						<p>I spoke to <span class="mention person" about="ClintBetts" data-sort="BettsClint" data-label="Clint Betts"><a href="https://twitter.com/clintbetts">Clint Betts</a></span>, co-founder of the <span class="mention place"about="SiliconSlopes">Silicon Slopes</span> advocacy group, who argues that the success of the local startup scene is largely because <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> is a good place to live.</p>

						<p><span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span> has a low cost of living. It’s clean and safe. The schools are good. It’s got a reliable and affordable public transport system. If you want to start a family, you can easily afford to buy or rent a house. People are friendly. The city is surrounded by gorgeous, rugged countryside.</p>
						
						<figure>
							<img src="imgs\mormons2\img4.jpg">
						</figure>
						
						<p>These factors keep talent within the state, while also attracting skilled developers and entrepreneurs from other major cities.</p>

						<p><span class="mention place" about="SiliconSlopes">Silicon Slopes</span> might not be on everyone’s tongue, but with <span class="mention place" about="SanFrancisco">San Francisco</span>’s housing crisis showing no sign of abating, I wouldn’t be surprised to see <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span>’s relevance increase in the coming years.</p>

						<p><span class="mention person" about="Mark Hofmann" data-sort="HofmannMark" data-label="Mark Hofmann">Mark Hofmann</span>’s notorious and deadly legacy will always be inextricably tied to the <span class="mention org" about="LDS" data-sort="LDS" data-label="Church of Jessus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span>, but the impact of his machinations spread far outside of <span class="mention place" about="Utah" data-sort="Utah" data-label="Utah">Utah</span> and the church. The new documentary about the case, <cite>Murder Among the Mormons</cite>, was one of the most-watched shows on <span class="mention org" about="Netflix" data-sort="Netflix" data-label="Netflix">Netflix</span> the week it dropped. The three-part series explores how <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> fooled a nationwide community of scholars, investigators and collectors, the bombings that killed two people and, finally, the mistakes he made that led to his capture.</p>

						<p>The documentary makers, <span class="mention person" about="JaredHess" data-sort="HessJared" data-label="Jared Hess">Jared Hess</span> (Napoleon Dynamite) and <span class="mention person" about="TylerMeasom" data-sort="MeasomTyler" data-label="Tayler Measom">Tyler Measom</span> (An Honest Liar), interviewed former <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span> Historian <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley" data-sort="TurleyRichard" data-label="Richard Turley">Richard Turley</span> for the true crime series. When I spoke to him following its release <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> described himself as a “fly on the wall” during the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> bombing and forgery investigations. He later wrote a book detailing his observations called <cite><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victims-CHURCH-MARK-HOFMANN-CASE/dp/0252018850">Victims: The <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span> and the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> Case</cite></a>. He wrote it, in part, to address the rampant rumors and speculation about the church’s dealings with <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>.</p> 

						<p>“I basically entered a crime scene,” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said of the time he started working in the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span>’s history department in 1986, right in the middle of the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> investigation. <q>“The police were looking for a motive for murder.”</q></p>

						</figure>

						<p>The motive became apparent when forensic investigators not only uncovered <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s forgery of the <span class="mention concept" about="SalamanderLetter" data-sort="SalamanderLetter" data-label="Salamander Letter">Salamander Letter</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="OathofaFreeman" data-sort="OathofaFreeman" data-label="Oath of a Freeman">Oath of a Freeman</span> but began to realize just how prolific of a counterfeiter he had been. The turning point came with the so-called <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin Collection</span>—a collection of writings by early Mormon leader <span class="mention person"about="WilliamMcLellin" data-sort="McLellinWilliamE." data-label="William E. McLellin">William E. McLellin</span>. <span class="mention person" about="WilliamMcLellin">McLellin</span> was estranged from the church, and <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> claimed the content of the collection would be damning to the faith. (The <span class="mention concept" about="SalamanderLetter">Salamander Letter</span>, forged by <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>, also challenged LDS beliefs—detailing it was a white salamander that led founder <span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith" data-sort="SmithJoseph" data-label="Joseph Smith">Joseph Smith</span> to the gold plates, from which he translated the <cite><span class="mention concept" about="Book of Mormon" data-sort="BookofMormon" data-label="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</span></cite>, and not an angel.)</p> 

						<p>“He spun this tale of a highly expansive <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin collection</span> with letters from <span class="mention person" about="EmmaSmith" data-sort="SmithEmma" data-label="Emma Smith">Emma Smith</span>—<span class="mention person" about="JosephSmith">Joseph Smith</span>’s wife—and other figures related to the church,” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said. <span class="mention person" data-label="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> reportedly offered to sell the collection to both <span class="mention person" about="AlvinRust" data-sort="RustAlvin" data-label="Alvin Rust">Alvin Rust</span>, a collector of rare coins and other artifacts, as well as <span class="mention person" about="StevenChristensen" data-sort="ChristensenSteven" data-label="Steven Christensen">Steven Christensen</span>, a <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity" data-sort="SaltLakeCity" data-label="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</span> businessman who had previously bought and donated the <span class="mention concept" about="SalamanderLetter">Salamander Letter to the <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span>.</p>

						<p>But <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hoffman</span> ran out of time. “He had created a potential forgery that was so large, he couldn’t carry it out in the time that he had. That’s when he resorted to bombs,” said <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>. The first bomb exploded on Oct. 15, 1985, in the <span class="mention place" about="JudgeBuilding" data-sort="JudgeBuilding" data-label="Jude Building">Judge Building</span> in downtown <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</span>. The blast killed <span class="mention person" about="StevenChristensen">Christensen</span>, who had received the bomb in a package addressed to him. The second bomb, meant for <span class="mention person" about="StevenChristensen">Christensen</span>’s business partner, <span class="mention person" about="GarySheets" data-sort="SheetsGary" data-label="Gary Sheets">Gary Sheets</span>, instead killed his wife, <span class="mention person" about="KathySheets" data-sort="SheetsKathy" data-label="Kathy Sheets">Kathy</span>. The third bomb blew up <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s own car, along with the unfinished forgery of the <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin Collection</span> for police to find.</p> 

					<h2>There’s no telling how many <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> forgeries are still out there</h2>

						<p>The body of <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s forged work far exceeded the half-finished <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin collection</span> and the infamous <span class="mention concept" about="SalamanderLetter">Salamander Letter</span>, doing untold damage not just to the record of <span class="mention place" about="Utah">Utah</span> and <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span> history, but American and world history as well.</p>

						<p>“When you’re a historian, you’re gathering pieces of a mosaic and putting it on the wall to see what it becomes,” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said. <q>“I think the damage that <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> did—using the mosaic metaphor—was akin to taking a whole dump truck of forged pieces and scattering them widely. So the genuine pieces of the past are mixed in with fakes and forgeries.”</q> Those forgeries make it more difficult to form an accurate picture—or mosaic, if you will—of the past.</p> 

						<p><q>“<span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> forgeries will continue to be discovered,”</q> <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said.

At the end of his presentation, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> brought up a sheet of signatures forged by Hofmann that was found in his prison mattress. Most of the known Hofmann forgeries could be tied to one of the signatures on that sheet. “As I mentioned those names,” said <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>, “prominent scholars in the audience began to make exclamations and moans and sighs as they realized this wasn’t just a Utah problem, but a problem for American and world history generally.”</p></q>

						<p>Case in point: <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>’s published work on the Hofmann bombings helped one person, in the middle of acquiring an <span class="mention person" about="EmilyDickenson" data-sort="DickensonEmily" data-label="EmilyDickenson">Emily Dickenson</span> piece, discover it to be a <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> forgery before it was too late. But, because there is no telling how many <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> forgeries are still out there, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> has a warning for collectors: “Caveat emptor.” Buyer beware.</p> 

						<p><q>“Better do your homework to figure out whose hands it has passed through and where it came from,”</q> said <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>. <q>“And, if you’re going to spend a lot of money, I’d have a document examiner take a look at it before you buy.”</q>  According to <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>, <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> was not above adding signatures to authentic documents to increase their value. Anything that passed through <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s hands should be suspect.</p> 

					<h2>The secret of <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span>’s (temporary) success</h2>

						<p>Beyond being a talented counterfeiter, <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> knew how to play people. <q>“<span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> held himself out as a bit of a bumbling fool,”</q> explains <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>. <q>“The persona was very deliberate on his part. He just didn’t seem smart enough to create these sophisticated things.”</q></p> 

						<p><span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> also played on confirmation bias: our tendency to seek out new evidence that confirmed our existing beliefs or theories, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> says. <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> would discover what people hoped to find and, it just so happened, that he might have what they were looking for. <q>“If someone gives you evidence to confirm your existing bias, you accept it uncritically,”</q> explained <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>. <q>“<span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> played off confirmation bias both for and against the church.”</q></p>

						<p>That’s why <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> recommends a healthy dose of skepticism when confronted with any new information or evidence, especially if it confirms our existing bias. Skepticism has saved <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> before. <q>“I have been the victim of people trying to do another <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>, but, due to my experience and skepticism that I have naturally, I’ve been able to stop these schemes before they develop too far.”</q></p>

						<p>The <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span> has also taken to heart the lessons learned from dealing with <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>. <q>“Basically, what happened before I got to the church historic department, people would acquire materials, put them on the shelf and eventually someone would get around to cataloging them.”</q></p>

						<p>But, this presented a problem if, in the meantime, the only person who knew a specific piece was in the collection, left the department or passed away. Put simply, the church didn’t know what it had, making them easier prey for forgers trying to sell fakes of pieces the church possessed. For instance, in the case of <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s collection of <span class="mention concept" about="McLellinCollection">McLellin</span> writings, a portion of the real writings had been in sitting on a shelf in the church archives all along.</p> 

						<p>So, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> says, the church launched a project to catalog everything in the archives. They also instituted a policy that required the archivist who added material to create a corresponding record entry when they brought it in.</p> 

						<p>The church also implemented technology to thwart another of <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s known techniques: going into libraries, shops or archives and removing or adding items or pages from an existing work. Now, the church archives use a highly sensitive scale that can detect such tampering.</p>

						<p>Despite the countermeasures, <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> believes that there could always be another <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span>. He referenced <span class="mention person" about="MichaelGeorge" data-sort="GeorgeMichael" data-label="Michael George">Michael George</span>, the <span class="mention place" about="SaltLakeCounty"data-sort="SaltLakeCounty" data-label="Salt Lake County">Salt Lake County</span> investigator on the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> case. “When asked, ‘was <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> the greatest forger ever?’ <span class="mention person" about="MichaelGeorge">George</span> said, <q>‘he’s the greatest forger ever caught.’</q>”</p>

						<p>While many interviewed for <cite>Murder Among the Mormons</cite> begrudgingly acknowledged <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span>’s genius, he still made a number of mistakes that led to his inevitable capture. <q>“He got greedy and in over his head,”</q> <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> says.</p> 

						<p>There have already been <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> copycats. <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> predicted, “the more people understand about the case and what happened, the more copycats there will be.” <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> said he writes about the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Hofmann</span> copycats he has since encountered in the updated second edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victims-CHURCH-MARK-HOFMANN-CASE/dp/0252018850"><cite>Victims: The <span class="mention org" about="LDS">LDS Church</span></cite></a> and the <cite><span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> Case</cite>, which is available Friday, March 12, 2021. </p>

						<p>While <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span> hailed the <span class="mention org" about="Netflix">Netflix</span> documentary as being able to take a <q>“highly complex and esoteric story and portray it in a style that makes it generally accessible to the public,”</q> he does have some reservations about the surge of attention to the <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> case. <q>“My big worry is that there is a tendency among some people to lionize criminals and turn them into folk heroes,”</q> said <span class="mention person" about="RichardTurley">Turley</span>.  <q>“Because <span class="mention person" about="MarkHofmann">Mark Hofmann</span> displayed a significant amount of skill in forging a broad range of items, there may be some who look at him in a way that may overshadow his psychopathic tendencies. I hope people won’t create a folk hero out of a killer.”</q></p>
