						<p class="one">“<span id="cap">I</span> don’t think it will be the <span class="mention concept" about="animal">humans</span>. I think we’ll go quite early on,” says <span class="mention person" about="JulieGray" data-sort="GrayJulie" data-label="Julie Gray">Julie Gray</span> with a laugh. I’ve just asked <span class="mention person" about="JulieGray" data-sort="GrayJulie" data-label="Julie Gray">Gray</span>, a <span class="mention concept" about="plant">plant</span> molecular biologist at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofSheffield" data-label="University of Sheffield">University of Sheffield</span>, which species she thinks would be the last ones standing if we don’t take <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190304-human-evolution-means-we-can-tackle-climate-change">transformative action on <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change</a>. Even with our extraordinary capacity for innovation and adaptability, <span class="mention concept" about="animal">humans</span>, it turns out, probably won’t be among the survivors.</p>

				<p>This is partly because <span class="mention concept" about="animal">humans</span> reproduce agonisingly slowly and generally just one or two at a time – as do some other favourite <span class="mention concept" about="animal">animals</span>, like <span class="mention concept" about="animal">pandas</span>. Organisms that can produce many offspring quickly may have a better shot at avoiding extinction.</p>

				<p>It may seem like just a thought experiment. But discussing which species are more, or less, able to survive <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change is disturbingly concrete. As a blockbuster biodiversity report stated recently, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48133143?ocid=wsnews.chat-apps.in-app-msg.whatsapp.trial.link1_.auin">one in every four species</a> currently faces extinction. Much of this vulnerability is linked to <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change, which is bringing about higher temperatures, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171130-the-ambitious-plan-to-stop-the-ground-from-sinking">sea level rise</a>, more variable conditions and more extreme weather, among other impacts.</p>

					</ul>
				</p>
							
					<p>Some caveats are in order. While the seriousness of <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change is undeniable, it’s impossible to know exactly how those effects will play out for species vulnerability, especially far into the future. <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/identifying-future-victims-of-climate-change-64347">Methods of forecasting vulnerability are ever evolving</a>, while limited and inconsistent data, plus the complex interactions of policies, land-use changes, and ecological effects, mean that projections aren’t set in stone. <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change vulnerability assessments have had <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-10-urgent-species-threatened-climate.html">biases and blind spots</a> (just as <span class="mention concept" about="animal">humans</span> do more generally). <span>(Read more about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190304-human-evolution-means-we-can-tackle-climate-change">how our cognitive biases prevent <span class="mention concept" about="climate"> climate</span>action</a>)</span>. Moreover, the indirect effects that are responsible for many <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change impacts on populations, such as in the food chain, are <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.1890">more complex to model</a> than direct effects.</p>

					</figure>
					
					<p>Another source of uncertainty has to do with life forms’ capacity to adapt. Take <span class="mention concept" about="animal">ectotherms</span> (cold-blooded <span class="mention concept" about="animal">animal</span> like <span class="mention concept" about="animal">reptiles</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="animal">amphibians</span>), which have historically been <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/warming-threatens-reptiles-more-than-birds-and-mammals/?redirect=1">slower to adapt to climatic change</a> than <span class="mention concept" about="animal">endotherms</span>. For one thing, they are less able to adjust their body temperatures. But there are exceptions, like the <span class="mention concept" about="animal">American bullfrog</span>, which may actually find more habitable environments as a consequence of warming.</p>
					
					<figure class="credits">

						</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>And, of course, there is an alternative: we <span class="mention concept" about="animal">humans</span> could get our acts together and stop the <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> crisis from continuing to snowball by adopting policies and lifestyles that reduce greenhouse gases. But for the purposes of these projections, we’re assuming that’s not going to happen.</p>

					<h2>Tenacious trends</h2>  
					
					<span class="mention concept" about="plant"></span>

					<p>Even with the uncertainties, we can make some educated guesses about broad patterns.</p>

					<p>Heat tolerant and drought resistant <span class="mention concept" about="plant">plants</span>, like those found in deserts rather than rainforests, are more likely to survive. So are <span class="mention concept" about="plant">plants</span> whose seeds can be dispersed over long distances, for instance by wind or ocean currents (like coconuts), rather than by ants (like some acacias). <a href="https://news.iu.edu/stories/2019/05/iub/releases/31-native-plants-climate-change-risk.html"> <span class="mention concept" about="plant">Plants</span> that can adjust their flowering times</a> may also be better able to deal with higher temperatures. <span class="mention person" about="JenLau" data-sort="LauJen" data-label="Jen Lau">Jen Lau</span>, a biologist at <span class="mention organization" about="IndianaUniversityBloomington" data-label="IndianaUniversityBloomington">Indiana University Bloomington</span>
					, suggests that this may give non-native <span class="mention concept" about="plant">plants</span> the advantage when it comes to responding to <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change.</p>

					<p>We also can look to history as a guide. The fossil record contains signs of how species have coped with previous climatic shifts. There are genetic clues to long-term survival too, such as in the <a href="https://news.rutgers.edu/how-some-algae-may-survive-climate-change/20180927#.XOs9f4hKjIV">hardy green microalgae that adapted to saltier environments</a> over millions of years – a finding only made in September 2018 by <span class="mention person" about="FatimaFoflonker" data-sort="FoflonkerFatima" data-label="Fatima Foflonker">Fatima Foflonker</span> of Rutgers and colleagues.</p>
					
					<p>Importantly, though, the uniquely devastating nature of the current human-made <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> crisis means that we can’t fully rely on benchmarks from the past.</p>

					<p>“The <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change that we see in the future will differ in many ways from the <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change that we’ve seen in the past”, notes <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Jamie Carr</span>, an outreach officer for the <span class="mention organization" about="ClimateChangeSpecialistGroup" data-label="Climate Change Specialist Group"> <span class="mention concept" about="climate">Climate</span> Change Specialist Group</span> of the <span class="mention organization" about="IUCNSpeciesSurvivalCommission" data-label="IUCN Species Survival Commission">IUCN Species Survival Commission</span>.</p>

					<p>The historical record does point to the tenacity of <span class="mention concept" about="animal">cockroaches</span>. These largely unloved critters “have survived every mass extinction event in history so far”, says <span class="mention person" about="AsmeretAsefawBerhe" data-sort="BerheAsmeretAsefaw" data-label="Asmeret Asefaw Berhe">Asmeret Asefaw Berhe</span>, a soil biogeochemist at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofCalifornia" data-label="UniversityofCalifornia">University of California</span>, Merced. For instance, <span class="mention concept" about="animal">cockroaches</span> adapted to an increasingly arid <span class="mention place" about="Australia" data-label="Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q881">Australia</span>, tens of millions of years ago, by <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2015.2869">starting to burrow into soil</a>.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>This shows two characteristics, says <span class="mention person" about="RobertNasi" data-sort="NasiRobert" data-label="Robert Nasi">Robert Nasi</span>, the director general of the <span class="mention organization" about="CenterforInternationalForestryResearch(CIFOR)" data-label="Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)">Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)</span>: an “ability to hide and protect in buffered conditions (e.g. underground)” and a long evolutionary history, as in general “ancient species appear more resilient than younger ones”. These are among the traits that, <span class="mention person" about="RobertNasi" data-sort="NasiRobert" data-label="Robert Nasi">Nasi</span> says, are linked to surviving large catastrophic events which triggered major changes in <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span>.</p>

					<p><span class="mention concept" about="animal">Cockroaches</span> also tend to not be picky eaters. Having broad diets means that <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change will be less of a threat to the food sources of species that are not too fussy about their food, such as <span class="mention concept" about="animal">rats</span>, opportunistic <span class="mention concept" about="animal">birds</span>, and urban <span class="mention concept" about="animal">raccoons</span>.</p>

					<p>As a comparison, take an <span class="mention concept" about="animal">animal</span> like the <span class="mention concept" about="animal">koala</span>. <span class="mention concept" about="animal">Koalas</span> eat primarily eucalyptus leaves, which are becoming less nutritious due to increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. As a result, <a href="https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/import/downloads/fact_sheet_red_list_koala_v2.pdf"> <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change is increasing their risk of starvation</a>.</p>

						</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>As well as having a specialised diet, <span class="mention concept" about="animal">koalas</span> have low genetic diversity – one reason that <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-disease-health-koalas-australia/">chlamydia has ravaged wild <span class="mention concept" about="animal">koala</span> populations</a>. These are worrying traits in terms of extinction risk. “In many cases, specialised species are those that we expect to see disappear first,” says <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Carr</span>. This extends to species in microhabitats like high elevation montane forests, or those in narrow ranges, like <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-climate-change-could-affect-some-of-west-africas-iconic-bird-species-117444">some <span class="mention concept" about="animal">tropical birds</span></a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/10/frightening-number-of-plant-extinctions-found-in-global-survey">small-island <span class="mention concept" about="plant">plants</span></a>. Also vulnerable are species that depend on pristine environments.</p>

					<p>That’s compared to the “early successional” species that succeed in disturbed habitats, such as grasslands and young forest. These species “might do well under <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change because they thrive in states of change and transition”, says <span class="mention person" about="JessicaHellmann" data-sort="HellmannJessica" data-label="Jessica Hellmann">Jessica Hellmann</span>, who leads the <span class="mention organization" about="InstituteontheEnvironment" data-label="Institute on the Environment">Institute on the Environment</span> at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofMinnesota" data-label="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</span>. “For example, <span class="mention concept" about="animal">deer</span> (in the <span class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span>) are common in suburban areas and thrive where forests have been removed or are regularly disturbed.”</p>

					<p>Species that <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Carr</span> calls “mobile generalists”, which can move and adapt to different environments, are likely to be more durable in the face of <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change. While this adaptability is generally positive, it might come at a cost to other parts of an ecosystem. Invasive species like <span class="mention concept" about="animal">cane toads</span>, which are poisonous, have led to local extinctions of other species like <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-indigenous-expertise-improves-science-the-curious-case-of-shy-lizards-and-deadly-cane-toads-113997"> <span class="mention concept" about="animal">quolls</span> (carnivorous <span class="mention concept" about="animal">marsupials</span>) and <span class="mention concept" about="animal">monitors</span> (large <span class="mention concept" about="animal">lizards</span>)</a> in <span class="mention place" about="Australia" data-label="Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q408">Australia</span>. And <span class="mention person" about="JessicaHellmann" data-sort="HellmannJessica" data-label="Jessica Hellmann">Hellmann</span> says that the versatility of invasive plant species “leads to the worry that, in addition to losing vulnerable species, a warmer world will be a weedier world”. The weeds typically found along roadsides may be especially long-lasting in comparison with other <span class="mention concept" about="plant">plants</span>.</p>

					<p>Of course, many organisms are intrinsically less mobile. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236584803_Will_plant_movements_keep_up_with_climate_change">Most <span class="mention concept" about="plant">plants</span> will be unable to move quickly enough</a> to keep pace with <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151228-heres-how-climate-change-will-affect-what-you-eat">rapid heating</a>, although they’ve done so in response to the slower <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climatic</span> changes of the past.</p>

					<h2>Buffer zones</h2>

					<p>The good news is that some specialised species might have a buffer known as <a href="https://www.climaterefugia.org/about-us"><span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change refugia</a>: areas that are relatively protected from <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change’s consequences, such as deep sea canyons. Although deep sea zones are <a href="https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.203/">heating up and declining in oxygen concentrations</a>, <span class="mention person" about="JonathonStillman" data-sort="StillmanJonathon" data-label="Jonathon Stillman">Jonathon Stillman</span>, a marine environmental physiologist at <span class="mention organization" about="SanFranciscoStateUniversity" data-label="San Francisco State University">San Francisco State University</span>, suggests that deep sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems, specifically, might be one bright spot in an otherwise mostly bleak situation.</p>

					<p>“They are pretty much uncoupled from the surface of our planet and I doubt that <span class="mention concept" about="climate">climate</span> change will impact them in the least,” he says. “Humanity didn’t even know they existed until 1977. Their energy comes from the core of our Earth rather than from the Sun, and their already extreme habitat is unlikely to be altered by changes happening at the ocean surface.”</p>

					<p>Similarly,<span class="mention person" about="DouglasSheil" data-sort="SheilDouglas" data-label="Douglas Sheil">Douglas Sheil</span>, a tropical forest ecologist at the <span class="mention organization" about="NorwegianUniversityofLifeSciences" data-label="Norwegian University of Life Sciences">Norwegian University of Life Sciences</span>, suggests that “at some point in the future the only vertebrate species surviving in <span class="mention place" about="Africa" data-label="Africa" data-wikidata-id="Q15">Africa</span> might be a <span class="mention concept" about="animal">blind cave fish</span> deep underground”. As in the deep sea hydrothermal vents, “many species remain undiscovered and thus unknown – <span class="mention place" about="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>’s first <span class="mention concept" about="animal">cave fish</span> was only found in <span class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span> in 2015.”</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160209-this-is-how-to-survive-if-you-spend-your-life-in-boilin-water"><span class="mention concept" about="organism">Thermophiles</span></a> (heat-adapted <span class="mention concept" about="organism">organisms</span>) living in extreme environments like volcanic springs are also likely to be less affected by surface temperature changes. Indeed, the <span class="mention concept" about="organism">organisms</span> best able to live in severe circumstances are <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/microbes-and-me">microbes</a>, as noted by many of the scientists I’ve surveyed. Computer modelling suggests that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23135934">only <span class="mention concept" about="organism">microbes</span> would be able to survive increasing solar intensity</a>. Soil biogeochemist <span class="mention person" about="AsmeretAsefawBerhe" data-sort="BerheAsmeretAsefaw" data-label="Asmeret Asefaw Berhe">Berhe</span> says of <span class="mention concept" about="organism">archaea</span>, one of the major types of <span class="mention concept" about="organism">microbes</span>, “these critters have figured out how to live in the most extreme of environments”.</p>

					<p>Not quite as tiny but also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05796-x">nearly indestructible</a> are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/27/the-five-tardigrades-tiny-but-tough-subglacial-lake-antarctica-heat-cold-vacuum-space-resilience">tardigrades</a>, commonly known as <span class="mention concept" about="organism">water bears</span>. Environmental physiologist <span class="mention person" about="JonathonStillman" data-sort="StillmanJonathon" data-label="Jonathon Stillman">Stillman</span> enthuses: “They can survive the vacuum of outer space, extreme dehydration, and very high temperatures. If you are a Star Trek fan, you have learned about them in a sci-fi setting, but they are real creatures that live across most habitats on <span class="mention place" about="Earth" data-label="Earth" data-wikidata-id="Q2">Earth</span>.”</p>

					<p>The future will have not only more extreme environments, but also more urban, human-altered spaces. So “resistant species would likely be the ones that are well attuned to living in human-modified habitats such as urban parks and gardens, agricultural areas, farms, tree plantations, and so on”, says <span class="mention person" about="ArvinCDiesmos" data-sort="DiesmosArvinC" data-label="ArvinCDiesmos">Arvin C Diesmos</span>, a herpetology curator at the <span class="mention organization" about="PhilippineNationalMuseumofNaturalHistory" data-label="Philippine National Museum of Natural History">Philippine National Museum of Natural History</span>.</p>

					<p><span class="mention organization" about="CIFOR" data-label="CIFOR">CIFOR</span>:’s <span class="mention person" about="RobertNasi" data-sort="NasiRobert" data-label="Robert Nasi">Nasi</span> sums it up. “The winners will be very small, preferably <span class="mention concept" about="animal">endotherms</span> if <span class="mention concept" about="animal">vertebrates</span>, highly adaptable, omnivorous or able to live in extreme conditions.”</p>

					<p>Of course, to some extent <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190327-the-young-minds-solving-climate-change">we already know what’s needed</a> to limit the bleakness of the future natural world. This includes reducing greenhouse gases; protecting biodiversity; restoring connectivity between habitats (rather than building endless dams, roads and walls); and reducing interrelated threats like pollution and land harvesting. Even species that are close to extinction, like <span class="mention concept" about="animal">Saiga antelopes</span>, can be brought back from the brink <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.13112">with enough conservation effort</a>. To reflect the power of sustained conservation, scientists <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2018/03/iucn-green-list-of-species-a-new-way-to-measure-conservation-success/">are developing a Green List</a> of species on the road to recovery and full health, to complement the <span class="mention organization" about="InternationalUnionforConservationofNature" data-label="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</span>’s Red List of threatened species.</p>

					<p><span id="cap">T</span>he <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">later middle ages</span>, and the years immediately following, were one of the most <span class="mention concept" about="dog">‘doggy’ periods</span> in history. Hunting and hawking were by far the most popular sports of the leisured classes, who also liked keeping <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> simply as pets; and the rest of the population used them for protection and herding. Performing <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> were much admired, and people loved to hear fabulous yarns of the extraordinary fidelity and intelligence of <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>.</p>

					<p>Indeed, the great <span class="mention person" about="DukeofBerry" data-sort="DukeofBerry" data-label="DukeofBerry">Duke of Berry</span> went personally to see a <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> that refused to leave its master’s grave, and gave a sum of money to a neighbour to keep the faithful beast in food for the rest of its days. True, rabies was unpleasantly common; but that was one of the ills that flesh is heir to, not to be held against the canine race – and for the bite of a mad <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> you had a wide choice of remedies, ranging from goat’s liver to sea bathing.</p>

					<p>The aristocrats of <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">medieval dogdom</span> were grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> and what our ancestors called ‘running <span class="mention concept" about="dog"><span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span>’, by which, illogically, they meant <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> that hunt by scent rather than speed. By grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> they meant anything of a <span class="mention concept" about="breed">greyhound type</span>, from an <span class="mention concept" about="breed">Irish wolfhound</span> to a tiny <span class="mention concept" about="breeds">Italian greyhound</span>, which is one of the difficulties facing <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog-genealogists</span>. A <span class="mention concept" about="breeds">greyhound</span>, the favoured gift of princes, was the usual hero of the <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">medieval</span> <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> story.</p>

					<p>He should, says a <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">14th-century writer</span>, be courteous and not too fierce ‘wel folowing his maistre and doyng whatever he hym commandeth, he shuld be good and kyndly and clene, glad and joyful and playeng, wel willyng and goodly to all maner folkes save to the wild beestis’. This paragon was the noble lord’s special pet, and his effigy was often placed on tombstones at his master’s feet. The knight’s lady was apt to have lap <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>, and their effigies, too, singly or in pairs, are found carved on tombs, complete with collar and little bells.</p>

					<p>Toy <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>, like fashionable clothes, always seem to provoke moralists’ ire, and one 16th-century critic, declaring that they were sought for to satisfy ‘Wanton women’s willes’, condemned them as ‘instruments of follie to play and dallie withal, in trifling away the treasure of time, to withdraw their minds from more commendable exercises, a sillie poore shift to shun their irksome idleness’.</p>

					<p>The smaller ‘these puppies’ are, he goes on to say, the more pleasure they provide as</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>plafellows for minsing mistresses to beare in their bosoms to succour with sleep in bed and nourish with meate at board, to lie in their laps and licke their lips as they lie in their wagons and coches ... Some of this kind of people delight more in their <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>, that are deprived of all possiblities of reason, than they do in children that are capable of wisdome and judgement</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>It has a familiar ring, and this stern admonisher would have been painfully shocked by the clerical author of an earlier and popular encyclopedia who listed among the commendable traits of the species the fact that a <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> will warn his mistress and her lover of the master’s approach. But moral discussions apart, what were these toys like? Some of them resembled pugs, but with longer noses. They came with long hair and short, the smooth-coated being more common, and extremes of build such as dachshund legs were not to be found.</p>

					<p>Ears might be short or drooping and tails were worn long, our ancestors apparently seeing nothing indecent in a normal tail. Many tombstones and brasses show <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> larger than lap <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> (possibly <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span>) and obviously commemorate special pets – notable among these is the tomb of the Black Prince in Canterbury Cathedral. Sometimes the <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span>’s name was added too, and ‘Jakke’ and ‘Terri’ still eye us gravely across the centuries.</p>

					<p>Much has been said about <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">medieval</span> <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> fighting over bones under the table in the great hall, and often enough they did, but <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">15th-century books</span> of etiquette pronounced it bad manners to stroke a <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> or cat at meals or to make one ‘thi felow at the tabull round’, and enjoined the valet preparing his master’s bedroom to ‘dryve out dogg and catte’.</p>

					<p>But owners’ notions varied, then as now, and a lady protagonist of hunting stated that <span class="mention concept" about="breed">spaniels</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="breed">grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span> slept on beds, proving that <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>’ tastes remain the same. Actually, <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> were regularly present at the kind of functions to which we would never dream of admitting them. They were often in evidence at royal courts, and, etiquette rules notwithstanding, the <span class="mention person" about="DukeofBerry" data-sort="DukeofBerry" data-label="DukeofBerry">Duke of Berry</span>’s Très Riches Heures depicts two small <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> right on the table at a ducal feast while in front of it a servant feeds an expectant-looking <span class="mention concept" about="breed">greyhound</span>.</p>

					<p>The <span class="mention person" about="DukeofBerry" data-sort="DukeofBerry" data-label="DukeofBerry">Duke</span>, in fact, was a great animal lover who kept a menagerie as well as extensive kennels. In those simpler times people travelled with <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> without arousing comment or difficulty – Chaucer’s tender-hearted Prioress had her lap <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>, and his hunting Monk his <span class="mention concept" about="breed">grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span>.</p>

					<p>Our ancestors even brought their <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> to church, a practice to which the authorities objected strenuously but not, it would seem, effectively, judging by the repetition of the protests; one of the most plaintive is a 15th-century monastic regulation against <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> and puppies which ‘oftentimes trouble the service by their barkings, and sometimes tear the church books’.</p>

					<p>The average man’s <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span>, however, earned his keep. In a society with no police and plenty of lawless characters, the watch <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> had an important place. For maximum efficiency he was supposed to be shut up by day to sleep so as to be fully on guard at night. Many guardians were simply big <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>, but the most highly regarded were usually mastiffs (something like their modern descendants) or alaunts.</p>

					<p>Of Spanish origin, <span class="mention concept" about="breed">alaunts</span> were large, active beasts built something like grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span>, but heavier, with coarse heads, short muzzles and prick ears (possibly cropped). They came in various colours, preferably white with black spots near the ears. The better-bred ones, or <span class="mention concept" about="breed"><em>alaunts gentils</em></span> were valued for hunting, but the coarser variety were in demand as watch <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> and were used by butchers to help herd cattle – they could, it was noted, be fed cheaply on ‘the foule thinges of the boochers rowe’.</p>

					<p>They were capable of holding an escaped ox, which made them the obvious choice for bull-baiting. They had a reputation for ferocity and contemporary illustrations often show them carefully muzzled. Shepherds and swineherds, of course, had to have <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>, but they were of no well-defined type and were as much for protection against thieves and wolves as for herding.</p>

					<p>Other labourers had their <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>, too, earning this praise from the <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">13th-century encyclopedist</span>, <span class="mention person" about="BartholomewtheEnglishman" data-sort="BartholomewtheEnglishman" data-label="BartholomewtheEnglishman">Bartholomew the Englishman</span>: ‘the mungrell curres, which serve to keep the bottles and bags, with vittell, of ditchers and hedgers will be sooner killed of a straunger than beaten off from their masters apparell and victuall’.</p>

					<p>The ubiquitous <span class="mention concept" about="breed">terrier</span> was also on the scene and was used, as his name implies, in pursuing foxes to their earths, but it is disappointing to his modern friends to find few references to him. Apparently he was simply taken for granted, and fox-hunting rated little notice in those days, as our practical forbears preferred edible game.</p>

					<p><span class="mention concept" about="breed">Spaniels</span> (so called because they came from Spain) were required for the popular sport of hawking, which attracted many as being both cheaper and less strenuous than hunting. The distressingly sheeplike build of these early <span class="mention concept" about="breed">spaniels</span> would pain modern fanciers. They were wavy-coated, fairly large and usually more leggy than most of their descendants, with shorter leg ‘feathers’. Their tails were not generally cut, and it is tempting to speculate that the <span class="mention concept" about="breed">bob-tailed spaniels</span> in the <em>Très Riches Heures</em> are early Brittanys, which are nowadays born short-tailed.</p>

					<p>It was held that the hair on the tail should be, if anything, longer than on the body. They were white, or tawny, or speckled, with heads strange to modern eyes, having rather pointed noses inclined to turn up. Nevertheless, they functioned competently enough, and were used to put up game and as <span class="mention concept" about="breed">retrievers</span> for land birds and for waterfowl, as hawking ‘on the river’ was a favourite amusement. They were also used as <span class="mention concept" about="breed">setters</span> to assist in taking partridges and quail with nets.</p>

					<p>The Elizabethan writer, <span class="mention person" about="EdwardTopsell" data-sort="TopsellEdward" data-label="EdwardTopsell">Edward Topsell</span>, describes <span class="mention concept" about="breed">‘water spagnels’</span> being used to hunt otters and depicts a beast clipped like a <span class="mention concept" about="breed">poodle</span> so that it might ‘be the less annoyed in swimming’ – and <span class="mention concept" about="breed">poodle</span>, <span class="mention concept" about="breed">spaniel</span> and <span class="mention concept" about="breed">retriever</span> may all dispute it as an ancestor. (The clipped animal that appears in so many of <span class="mention person" about="AlbrechtDürer" data-sort="DürerAlbrecht" data-label="AlbrechtDürer">Dürer</span>’s woodcuts, however, is clearly a poodle.)</p>

					<p>That great <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">14th-century sportsman</span>, <span class="mention person" about="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn" data-sort="deFoix-BéarnGastonIII" data-label="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn">Gaston</span>, Comte de Foix, author of the finest <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">medieval</span> hunting book, described <span class="mention concept" about="breed">spaniels</span> as faithful, affectionate and fond of going ‘before their maistre and playeng with their taile’, but he must have suffered from some particularly exuberant member of the breed, for he complains that, if you are taking your <span class="mention concept" about="breed">grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span> for a walk and have a <span class="mention concept" about="breed">spaniel</span> with you, he will chase geese, cattle or horses, and the <span class="mention concept" about="breed">grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span> through ‘his eggyng’ will attack too, and thus he is responsible for ‘al the ryot and al the harm’.</p>

					<p>He further declares that out hunting <span class="mention concept" about="breed">spaniels</span> are fighters and put the <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> off the line, which is manifestly unfair as they were never intended for hunting. But <span class="mention person" about="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn" data-sort="deFoix-BéarnGastonIII" data-label="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn">Gaston</span> was a fanatical Nimrod and devoted to his running <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span>. <span class="mention person" about="CharlesIer d'Orléans" data-sort="CharlesIerd'Orléans" data-label="CharlesIerd'Orléans">Duke Charles of Orleans</span>, on the other hand, wrote poems to his favourite <span class="mention concept" about="breed">spaniel</span>, ‘Briquet of the drooping ears’ (<em>Briquet aux pendantes oreilles</em>) – a charming one in praise of his field prowess and enthusiasm, and another beginning: ‘Let Baude range the bushes, old Briquet takes his rest ... an old fellow can do but little’, which sounds the sadder note of the true <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog-lover’s</span> affection for his ageing servant.</p>

					<p>The most fashionable sport of the time was stag-hunting, and for this both <span class="mention concept" about="breed">grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span> and ‘running <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span>’ (also termed ‘<em>raches</em>') were used, often together, the <span class="mention concept" about="breed">grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span> being slipped to stop the game quickly, or put in as relays to the pack, or, in the great battues sometimes organised for visiting notables, to turn back driven deer to the archers.</p>

					<p>The truly serious huntsman, however, liked best to watch the running <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> work alone, for <span class="mention concept" about="breed">grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span> and <span class="mention concept" about="breed">alaunts</span>, says <span class="mention person" about="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn" data-sort="deFoix-BéarnGastonIII" data-label="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn">Gaston de Foix</span>, finish the job too quickly but the ‘raches’ must ‘hunt al the day questyng and makyng gret melody in their lan-gage and saying gret villeny and chydeng the beest that thei enchace’. These <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> were rather like modern <span class="mention concept" about="breed">blood<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span> and a little like the type of <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> used for ‘still’ hunting – heavily built with powerful fore-quarters and short-muzzled heavy heads.</p>

					<p>Wide colour ranges were permissable in a pack, earlier taste running to white, black and white, or mottled, while the <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">late Middle Ages</span> preferred tawny brown. Coats were usually smooth, though rough-haired specimens might be found, or even smooth ones with long-haired tails. Although all sorts of animals besides the stag were hunted, the <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> used differed more by training than by breed.</p>

					<p><span class="mention concept" about="breed">Hart<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span></span>, however, were generally larger and faster than harriers, which were all-round beasts so called because they ‘harried’ the quarry (not because they were restricted to hares). Selected <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>, hand-picked for scent, staunchness, and possibly size, were trained as ‘limers’, that is, they hunted on leash and were used to find, or ‘harbour’, the stag, and later in the hunt to untangle the line if the pack should be at fault, but these were individual specialists and not a distinct breed.</p>

					<p>These animals, with the working <span class="mention concept" about="breed">grey<span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span>, were excellently cared for. Wealthy owners set up astonishingly high standards of kennel management, described in careful detail in <span class="mention person" about="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn" data-sort="deFoix-BéarnGastonIII" data-label="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn">Gaston de Foix</span>’s ‘<em>Traité de la Chasse</em>’. The kennel where the <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> sleep, he says, should be built of wood a foot clear of the ground, with a loft for greater coolness in summer and warmth in winter, and it should also have a chimney to warm the occupants when they are cold or wet.</p>

					<p>It should be enclosed in a sunny yard, and the door should be left open so that ‘the houndes may go withoute to play when them liketh for it is grete likyng for the houndes whan thei may goon in and out at their lust’ – as every <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> lover knows. <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> should be taken for a walk once or twice a day and allowed to run and play ‘in a fair medow in the sun’, and must be taken to a spot where they may eat grass to heal themselves if they are sick.</p>

					<p>The kennel is to be cleaned every morning and the floor thickly strewn with straw, renewed daily. The <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> are to be given fresh water twice a day and rubbed down with straw each morning. The staple food is bran bread, with meat from the chase, and game to be killed specially for them even out of the regular hunting season. Sick <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> may be given more fancy diets, such as goat’s milk, bean broth, chopped meat, or buttered eggs.</p>

					<p>Most of the kennel chores were performed by a <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog-boy</span>, an embryo huntsman who was expected to start learning his trade at the age of about seven and who, in addition to his other duties, had to learn the names and colours of the <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> and how to spin horsehair for their couplings. Besides this, he or some other child must be constantly in the kennel to prevent fights, even at night. In addition, it is laid down, in the uncompromising fashion of the age, that he should love his master and the <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span>, and, furthermore, that he should be beaten if he fails to do as he is told.</p>

					<p>These old-time hunting <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> reached a high degree of training, but the methods used must have been something of a trade secret, for not much is divulged – far less than was written on how to train hawks. <span class="mention person" about="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn" data-sort="deFoix-BéarnGastonIII" data-label="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn">Gaston de Foix</span> says, indeed, that ‘a <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounde</span> will lerne as a man al that a man wil teche hym’, but, apart from the rather obvious maxim that pupils should be rewarded for doing well and punished for mistakes, he gives away little. He lays down that you must never tell your <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> anything but the strict truth. One should not talk to them too much, but when one does it should be ‘in the most beautiful and gracious language that he can’.</p>

					<p>‘And by my faith,’ he adds, ‘I speak to my <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> as I would to a man ... and they understand me and do as I wish better than any man of my household, but I do not think that any other man can make them do as I do, nor peradventure will anyone do it more when I am dead’ – but then, <span class="mention person" about="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn" data-sort="deFoix-BéarnGastonIII" data-label="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn">Gaston</span> believed firmly that things were not as they had been in the old days. Whatever the means, <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> were trained to obey a wide variety of notes on the horn as well as a number of different calls and terms, and they were encouraged by name; in fact, examples are given of typical names, such as Beaumont, Latimer, Prince and Saracen.</p>

					<p>Considerable attention was bestowed on the medical care of canine aliments. Many of the treatments would startle a 20th-century veterinarian, yet they generally exhibit more common sense and less superstition than was currently applied to human sickness. Indeed, <span class="mention person" about="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn" data-sort="deFoix-BéarnGastonIII" data-label="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn">Gaston de Foix</span> shows a critical faculty rare in his day when he states that making nine waves pass over a suspected rabies victim ‘is but litel helpe’. He discusses madness at some length, and nine kinds are listed, some held to be non-contagious.</p>

					<p>He recommends that a suspected case be quarantined for four days to discover whether or not is is in fact madness. No kind of madness is regarded as curable, but prompt treatment of the bite of a mad <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> might prevent its development. Nearly as much space is devoted to various types of so-called ‘mange’, and some remarkable salves are described.</p>

					<p>There are detailed instructions on the care of injuries, including the splinting of broken bones, and <span class="mention person" about="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn" data-sort="deFoix-BéarnGastonIII" data-label="GastonIIIdeFoix-Béarn">Gaston</span>’s English translator, the <span class="mention person" about="DukeofYork" data-sort="DukeofYork" data-label="DukeofYork">Duke of York</span>, who was Master of Game to <span class="mention person" about="HenryIV" data-sort="HenryIV" data-label="HenryIV">Henry IV</span>, winds up with this exhortation: ‘God forbid that for a little labour or cost of this medicine, man should see his good kind <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hound</span> perish, that before hath made him so many comfortable disports at divers times in hunting.’</p>

					<p>In view of the <span class="mention concept" about="Middle Ages">medieval habit</span> of attributing moral qualities and moral responsibilities to animals, it is not surprising to find that <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span> sometimes received some of the benefits of religion. It is recorded that one <span class="mention person" about="DukeofOrleans" data-sort="DukeofOrleans" data-label="DukeofOrleans">Duke of Orleans</span> had masses said for his <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dogs</span>; and there was, of course, the famous <em>messe des chiens</em> on <span class="mention place" about="St Hubert" data-label="StHubert" data-wikidata-id="Q3462426">St Hubert</span>’s day, a custom which still survives. Certain <span class="mention concept" about="dog">hounds</span> of <span class="mention person" about="CharlesVI" data-sort="CharlesVI" data-label="CharlesVI">Charles VI</span> of <span class="mention place" about="France" data-label="France" data-wikidata-id="Q142">France</span> which fell ill were sent on a pilgrimage to hear mass at St Mesmer in order that they might recover.</p>

					<p>There was even once a <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog saint</span>; near <span class="mention place" about="Lyon" data-label="Lyon" data-wikidata-id="Q456">Lyon</span> a <span class="mention concept" about="breed">greyhound</span> was said to have killed a dangerous serpent attacking his master’s child and, like the mythical Gelert, was himself slain on suspicion when the child could not be found. Afterwards his remorseful master buried him honourably beneath a cairn of stones where trees were planted in his memory. Later the <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog</span> was revered as St Greyhound, or St Guinefort, and rites were held at the grave for sickly children suspected of being changelings. Before long, of course, the ecclesiastical authorities caught up with St Greyhound and the grave was destroyed.</p>

					<p>All in all, it is plain that modern <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog-lovers</span> should not be too self-satisfied over their advances in the care and handling of their pets, nor need <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog-haters</span> rage at the rising menace of the <span class="mention concept" about="dog">dog cult</span>.

				<h2>The pull of posting</h2>

				<p><span class="mention person" about="PauloOrdoveza" data-sort="OrdovezaPaulo" data-label="Paulo Ordoveza">Paulo Ordoveza</span> is a web developer and image verification expert who runs the <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">Twitter</span> account <a href="https://twitter.com/PicPedant">@picpedant</a>, where he debunks fake viral posts—and calls out the fakers. He sees firsthand the “greed for virality” that may drive the impulse to propagate misinformation. It’s “overdosing on the euphoria that comes from seeing those like and retweet numbers rise into the thousands,” he says.</p>

				<p>Getting a lot of likes and comments “gives us an immediate social reward,” says <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/erin-vogel"><span class="mention person" about="ErinVogel" data-sort="VogelErin" data-label="Erin Vogel">Erin Vogel</span></a>, a social psychologist and postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University. In other words, they make us feel good. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212001409">Studies have found</a> that posting to <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">social media</span> gives one’s self-esteem a temporary boost.</p>

				<p>The need to seek out things that make us feel good may be exacerbated right now, as people try to come to grips with a <span class="mention concept" about="Covid-19" data-sort="Covid-19" data-label="Covid-19">pandemic</span>, a collapsing economy, and sudden isolation. “In times when we’re all really lonely, it’s tempting to hold onto that feeling, especially if we’re posting something that gives people a lot of hope,” says Vogel. The idea that <span class="mention concept" about="animal" data-sort="animal" data-label="animal">animals</span> and nature could actually flourish during this crisis “could help give us a sense of meaning and purpose—that we went through this for a reason,” she says.</p>

				<p>It was the running theme of many of the viral tweets. “Nature just hit the reset button on us,” read a <a href="https://twitter.com/lucadb/status/1239863383354224641?s=20">tweet</a> celebrating the dolphins supposedly swimming in Venetian canals.</p>

				<h5>Despite <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">social media</span> posts claiming otherwise, dolphins are not swimming in <span class="mention place" about="Venice" data-sort="Venice" data-label="Venice">Venice</span>’s canals. This video footage was taken in Sardinia.</h5>
				
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><span class="mention place" about="Venice" data-sort="Venice" data-label="Venice">Venice</span> hasn&#39;t seen clear canal water in a very long time.

				<p>“I think people really want to believe in the power of nature to recover,” says <a href="https://discover.wooster.edu/sclayton/">Susan Clayton</a>, a professor of psychology and environmental studies at the College of Wooster, in Ohio. “People hope that, no matter what we’ve done, nature is powerful enough to rise above it.” (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/great-white-shark-meme-news-photography-animals-peschak">Read about how this incredible—and real—shark photo went viral.</a>)</p>

				<p>About half of Americans say they’ve been exposed to made-up news or information related to <span class="mention concept" about="Covid-19" data-sort="Covid-19" data-label="Covid-19">coronavirus</span>, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/03/18/americans-immersed-in-covid-19-news-most-think-media-are-doing-fairly-well-covering-it/">new Pew Research Center survey</a>. While a fake happy news story about dolphins in a canal may not be all that problematic, relatively speaking, there can still be harm in spreading false hope in times of crisis.</p>

				<p>These fake feel-good stories, Vogel says, can make people even more distrustful at a time when everyone already feels vulnerable. Finding out good news isn’t real “can be even more demoralizing than not hearing it at all.”</p>

				<p>Spots of hope on <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">social media</span> are likely to play a key role in keeping spirits up in the weeks and months ahead, as people self-quarantine in their homes and connect with each other through screens. “I’d encourage people to share positive things,” says Vogel. “But it doesn’t have to be anything dramatic. It just has to be true.”</p>
