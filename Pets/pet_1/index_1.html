				<p>“I don’t think it will be the <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span>. I think we’ll go quite early on,” says <span class="mention person" about="JulieGray" data-sort="GrayJulie" data-label="Julie Gray">Julie Gray</span> with a laugh. I’ve just asked <span class="mention person" about="JulieGray" data-sort="GrayJulie" data-label="Julie Gray">Gray</span>, a <span class="key" about="plant">plant</span> molecular biologist at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofSheffield" data-label="University of Sheffield">University of Sheffield</span>, which species she thinks would be the last ones standing if we don’t take <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190304-human-evolution-means-we-can-tackle-climate-change">transformative action on <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change</a>. Even with our extraordinary capacity for innovation and adaptability, <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span>, it turns out, probably won’t be among the survivors.</p>

				<p>This is partly because <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span> reproduce agonisingly slowly and generally just one or two at a time – as do some other favourite <span class="key" about="animal">animals</span>, like <span class="key" about="animal">pandas</span>. Organisms that can produce many offspring quickly may have a better shot at avoiding extinction.</p>

				<p>It may seem like just a thought experiment. But discussing which species are more, or less, able to survive <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change is disturbingly concrete. As a blockbuster biodiversity report stated recently, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48133143?ocid=wsnews.chat-apps.in-app-msg.whatsapp.trial.link1_.auin">one in every four species</a> currently faces extinction. Much of this vulnerability is linked to <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change, which is bringing about higher temperatures, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171130-the-ambitious-plan-to-stop-the-ground-from-sinking">sea level rise</a>, more variable conditions and more extreme weather, among other impacts.</p>

					</ul>
				</p>
							
					<p>Some caveats are in order. While the seriousness of <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change is undeniable, it’s impossible to know exactly how those effects will play out for species vulnerability, especially far into the future. <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/identifying-future-victims-of-climate-change-64347">Methods of forecasting vulnerability are ever evolving</a>, while limited and inconsistent data, plus the complex interactions of policies, land-use changes, and ecological effects, mean that projections aren’t set in stone. <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change vulnerability assessments have had <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-10-urgent-species-threatened-climate.html">biases and blind spots</a> (just as <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span> do more generally). <span>(Read more about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190304-human-evolution-means-we-can-tackle-climate-change">how our cognitive biases prevent <span class="key" about="climate"> climate</span>action</a>)</span>. Moreover, the indirect effects that are responsible for many <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change impacts on populations, such as in the food chain, are <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.1890">more complex to model</a> than direct effects.</p>

					</figure>
					
					<p>Another source of uncertainty has to do with life forms’ capacity to adapt. Take <span class="key" about="animal">ectotherms</span> (cold-blooded <span class="key" about="animal">animal</span> like <span class="key" about="animal">reptiles</span> and <span class="key" about="animal">amphibians</span>), which have historically been <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/warming-threatens-reptiles-more-than-birds-and-mammals/?redirect=1">slower to adapt to climatic change</a> than <span class="key" about="animal">endotherms</span>. For one thing, they are less able to adjust their body temperatures. But there are exceptions, like the <span class="key" about="animal">American bullfrog</span>, which may actually find more habitable environments as a consequence of warming.</p>
					
					<figure class="credits">

						</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>And, of course, there is an alternative: we <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span> could get our acts together and stop the <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> crisis from continuing to snowball by adopting policies and lifestyles that reduce greenhouse gases. But for the purposes of these projections, we’re assuming that’s not going to happen.</p>

					<h2>Tenacious trends</h2>  
					
					<span class="key" about="plant"></span>

					<p>Even with the uncertainties, we can make some educated guesses about broad patterns.</p>

					<p>Heat tolerant and drought resistant <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span>, like those found in deserts rather than rainforests, are more likely to survive. So are <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span> whose seeds can be dispersed over long distances, for instance by wind or ocean currents (like coconuts), rather than by ants (like some acacias). <a href="https://news.iu.edu/stories/2019/05/iub/releases/31-native-plants-climate-change-risk.html"> <span class="key" about="plant">Plants</span> that can adjust their flowering times</a> may also be better able to deal with higher temperatures. <span class="mention person" about="JenLau" data-sort="LauJen" data-label="Jen Lau">Jen Lau</span>, a biologist at <span class="mention organization" about="IndianaUniversityBloomington" data-label="IndianaUniversityBloomington">Indiana University Bloomington</span>
					, suggests that this may give non-native <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span> the advantage when it comes to responding to <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change.</p>

					<p>We also can look to history as a guide. The fossil record contains signs of how species have coped with previous climatic shifts. There are genetic clues to long-term survival too, such as in the <a href="https://news.rutgers.edu/how-some-algae-may-survive-climate-change/20180927#.XOs9f4hKjIV">hardy green microalgae that adapted to saltier environments</a> over millions of years – a finding only made in September 2018 by <span class="mention person" about="FatimaFoflonker" data-sort="FoflonkerFatima" data-label="Fatima Foflonker">Fatima Foflonker</span> of Rutgers and colleagues.</p>
					
					<p>Importantly, though, the uniquely devastating nature of the current human-made <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> crisis means that we can’t fully rely on benchmarks from the past.</p>

					<p>“The <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change that we see in the future will differ in many ways from the <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change that we’ve seen in the past”, notes <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Jamie Carr</span>, an outreach officer for the <span class="mention organization" about="ClimateChangeSpecialistGroup" data-label="Climate Change Specialist Group"> <span class="key" about="climate">Climate</span> Change Specialist Group</span> of the <span class="mention organization" about="IUCNSpeciesSurvivalCommission" data-label="IUCN Species Survival Commission">IUCN Species Survival Commission</span>.</p>

					<p>The historical record does point to the tenacity of <span class="key" about="animal">cockroaches</span>. These largely unloved critters “have survived every mass extinction event in history so far”, says <span class="mention person" about="AsmeretAsefawBerhe" data-sort="BerheAsmeretAsefaw" data-label="Asmeret Asefaw Berhe">Asmeret Asefaw Berhe</span>, a soil biogeochemist at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofCalifornia" data-label="UniversityofCalifornia">University of California</span>, Merced. For instance, <span class="key" about="animal">cockroaches</span> adapted to an increasingly arid <span class="mention place" about="Australia" data-label="Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q881">Australia</span>, tens of millions of years ago, by <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2015.2869">starting to burrow into soil</a>.</p>
					
					<figure class="credits">

						</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>This shows two characteristics, says <span class="mention person" about="RobertNasi" data-sort="NasiRobert" data-label="Robert Nasi">Robert Nasi</span>, the director general of the <span class="mention organization" about="CenterforInternationalForestryResearch(CIFOR)" data-label="Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)">Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)</span>: an “ability to hide and protect in buffered conditions (e.g. underground)” and a long evolutionary history, as in general “ancient species appear more resilient than younger ones”. These are among the traits that, <span class="mention person" about="RobertNasi" data-sort="NasiRobert" data-label="Robert Nasi">Nasi</span> says, are linked to surviving large catastrophic events which triggered major changes in <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span>.</p>

					<p><span class="key" about="animal">Cockroaches</span> also tend to not be picky eaters. Having broad diets means that <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change will be less of a threat to the food sources of species that are not too fussy about their food, such as <span class="key" about="animal">rats</span>, opportunistic <span class="key" about="animal">birds</span>, and urban <span class="key" about="animal">raccoons</span>.</p>

					<p>As a comparison, take an <span class="key" about="animal">animal</span> like the <span class="key" about="animal">koala</span>. <span class="key" about="animal">Koalas</span> eat primarily eucalyptus leaves, which are becoming less nutritious due to increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. As a result, <a href="https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/import/downloads/fact_sheet_red_list_koala_v2.pdf"> <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change is increasing their risk of starvation</a>.</p>

						</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>As well as having a specialised diet, <span class="key" about="animal">koalas</span> have low genetic diversity – one reason that <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-disease-health-koalas-australia/">chlamydia has ravaged wild <span class="key" about="animal">koala</span> populations</a>. These are worrying traits in terms of extinction risk. “In many cases, specialised species are those that we expect to see disappear first,” says <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Carr</span>. This extends to species in microhabitats like high elevation montane forests, or those in narrow ranges, like <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-climate-change-could-affect-some-of-west-africas-iconic-bird-species-117444">some <span class="key" about="animal">tropical birds</span></a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/10/frightening-number-of-plant-extinctions-found-in-global-survey">small-island <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span></a>. Also vulnerable are species that depend on pristine environments.</p>

					<p>That’s compared to the “early successional” species that succeed in disturbed habitats, such as grasslands and young forest. These species “might do well under <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change because they thrive in states of change and transition”, says <span class="mention person" about="JessicaHellmann" data-sort="HellmannJessica" data-label="Jessica Hellmann">Jessica Hellmann</span>, who leads the <span class="mention organization" about="InstituteontheEnvironment" data-label="Institute on the Environment">Institute on the Environment</span> at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofMinnesota" data-label="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</span>. “For example, <span class="key" about="animal">deer</span> (in the <span class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span>) are common in suburban areas and thrive where forests have been removed or are regularly disturbed.”</p>

					<p>Species that <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Carr</span> calls “mobile generalists”, which can move and adapt to different environments, are likely to be more durable in the face of <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change. While this adaptability is generally positive, it might come at a cost to other parts of an ecosystem. Invasive species like <span class="key" about="animal">cane toads</span>, which are poisonous, have led to local extinctions of other species like <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-indigenous-expertise-improves-science-the-curious-case-of-shy-lizards-and-deadly-cane-toads-113997"> <span class="key" about="animal">quolls</span> (carnivorous <span class="key" about="animal">marsupials</span>) and <span class="key" about="animal">monitors</span> (large <span class="key" about="animal">lizards</span>)</a> in <span class="mention place" about="Australia" data-label="Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q408">Australia</span>. And <span class="mention person" about="JessicaHellmann" data-sort="HellmannJessica" data-label="Jessica Hellmann">Hellmann</span> says that the versatility of invasive plant species “leads to the worry that, in addition to losing vulnerable species, a warmer world will be a weedier world”. The weeds typically found along roadsides may be especially long-lasting in comparison with other <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span>.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>Of course, many organisms are intrinsically less mobile. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236584803_Will_plant_movements_keep_up_with_climate_change">Most <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span> will be unable to move quickly enough</a> to keep pace with <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151228-heres-how-climate-change-will-affect-what-you-eat">rapid heating</a>, although they’ve done so in response to the slower <span class="key" about="climate">climatic</span> changes of the past.</p>

					<h2>Buffer zones</h2>

					<p>The good news is that some specialised species might have a buffer known as <a href="https://www.climaterefugia.org/about-us"><span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change refugia</a>: areas that are relatively protected from <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change’s consequences, such as deep sea canyons. Although deep sea zones are <a href="https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.203/">heating up and declining in oxygen concentrations</a>, <span class="mention person" about="JonathonStillman" data-sort="StillmanJonathon" data-label="Jonathon Stillman">Jonathon Stillman</span>, a marine environmental physiologist at <span class="mention organization" about="SanFranciscoStateUniversity" data-label="San Francisco State University">San Francisco State University</span>, suggests that deep sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems, specifically, might be one bright spot in an otherwise mostly bleak situation.</p>

					<p>“They are pretty much uncoupled from the surface of our planet and I doubt that <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change will impact them in the least,” he says. “Humanity didn’t even know they existed until 1977. Their energy comes from the core of our Earth rather than from the Sun, and their already extreme habitat is unlikely to be altered by changes happening at the ocean surface.”</p>

					<p>Similarly,<span class="mention person" about="DouglasSheil" data-sort="SheilDouglas" data-label="Douglas Sheil">Douglas Sheil</span>, a tropical forest ecologist at the <span class="mention organization" about="NorwegianUniversityofLifeSciences" data-label="Norwegian University of Life Sciences">Norwegian University of Life Sciences</span>, suggests that “at some point in the future the only vertebrate species surviving in <span class="mention place" about="Africa" data-label="Africa" data-wikidata-id="Q15">Africa</span> might be a <span class="key" about="animal">blind cave fish</span> deep underground”. As in the deep sea hydrothermal vents, “many species remain undiscovered and thus unknown – <span class="mention place" about="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>’s first <span class="key" about="animal">cave fish</span> was only found in <span class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span> in 2015.”</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160209-this-is-how-to-survive-if-you-spend-your-life-in-boilin-water"><span class="key" about="organism">Thermophiles</span></a> (heat-adapted <span class="key" about="organism">organisms</span>) living in extreme environments like volcanic springs are also likely to be less affected by surface temperature changes. Indeed, the <span class="key" about="organism">organisms</span> best able to live in severe circumstances are <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/microbes-and-me">microbes</a>, as noted by many of the scientists I’ve surveyed. Computer modelling suggests that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23135934">only <span class="key" about="organism">microbes</span> would be able to survive increasing solar intensity</a>. Soil biogeochemist <span class="mention person" about="AsmeretAsefawBerhe" data-sort="BerheAsmeretAsefaw" data-label="Asmeret Asefaw Berhe">Berhe</span> says of <span class="key" about="organism">archaea</span>, one of the major types of <span class="key" about="organism">microbes</span>, “these critters have figured out how to live in the most extreme of environments”.</p>

					<p>Not quite as tiny but also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05796-x">nearly indestructible</a> are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/27/the-five-tardigrades-tiny-but-tough-subglacial-lake-antarctica-heat-cold-vacuum-space-resilience">tardigrades</a>, commonly known as <span class="key" about="organism">water bears</span>. Environmental physiologist <span class="mention person" about="JonathonStillman" data-sort="StillmanJonathon" data-label="Jonathon Stillman">Stillman</span> enthuses: “They can survive the vacuum of outer space, extreme dehydration, and very high temperatures. If you are a Star Trek fan, you have learned about them in a sci-fi setting, but they are real creatures that live across most habitats on <span class="mention place" about="Earth" data-label="Earth" data-wikidata-id="Q2">Earth</span>.”</p>

					<p>The future will have not only more extreme environments, but also more urban, human-altered spaces.

					<p>Of course, to some extent <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190327-the-young-minds-solving-climate-change">we already know what’s needed</a> to limit the bleakness of the future natural world. This includes reducing greenhouse gases; protecting biodiversity; restoring connectivity between habitats (rather than building endless dams, roads and walls); and reducing interrelated threats like pollution and land harvesting. Even species that are close to extinction, like <span class="key" about="animal">Saiga antelopes</span>, can be brought back from the brink <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.13112">with enough conservation effort</a>.

				<p>“I don’t think it will be the <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span>. I think we’ll go quite early on,” says <span class="mention person" about="JulieGray" data-sort="GrayJulie" data-label="Julie Gray">Julie Gray</span> with a laugh. I’ve just asked <span class="mention person" about="JulieGray" data-sort="GrayJulie" data-label="Julie Gray">Gray</span>, a <span class="key" about="plant">plant</span> molecular biologist at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofSheffield" data-label="University of Sheffield">University of Sheffield</span>, which species she thinks would be the last ones standing if we don’t take <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190304-human-evolution-means-we-can-tackle-climate-change">transformative action on <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change</a>. Even with our extraordinary capacity for innovation and adaptability, <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span>, it turns out, probably won’t be among the survivors.</p>

				<p>This is partly because <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span> reproduce agonisingly slowly and generally just one or two at a time – as do some other favourite <span class="key" about="animal">animals</span>, like <span class="key" about="animal">pandas</span>. Organisms that can produce many offspring quickly may have a better shot at avoiding extinction.</p>

					<p>It may seem like just a thought experiment. But discussing which species are more, or less, able to survive <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change is disturbingly concrete. As a blockbuster biodiversity report stated recently, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48133143?ocid=wsnews.chat-apps.in-app-msg.whatsapp.trial.link1_.auin">one in every four species</a> currently faces extinction. Much of this vulnerability is linked to <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change, which is bringing about higher temperatures, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171130-the-ambitious-plan-to-stop-the-ground-from-sinking">sea level rise</a>, more variable conditions and more extreme weather, among other impacts.</p>

					</p>
							
					<p>Some caveats are in order. While the seriousness of <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change is undeniable, it’s impossible to know exactly how those effects will play out for species vulnerability, especially far into the future. <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/identifying-future-victims-of-climate-change-64347">Methods of forecasting vulnerability are ever evolving</a>, while limited and inconsistent data, plus the complex interactions of policies, land-use changes, and ecological effects, mean that projections aren’t set in stone. <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change vulnerability assessments have had <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-10-urgent-species-threatened-climate.html">biases and blind spots</a> (just as <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span> do more generally). <span>(Read more about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190304-human-evolution-means-we-can-tackle-climate-change">how our cognitive biases prevent <span class="key" about="climate"> climate</span>action</a>)</span>. Moreover, the indirect effects that are responsible for many <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change impacts on populations, such as in the food chain, are <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.1890">more complex to model</a> than direct effects.</p>

					<p>Another source of uncertainty has to do with life forms’ capacity to adapt. Take <span class="key" about="animal">ectotherms</span> (cold-blooded <span class="key" about="animal">animal</span> like <span class="key" about="animal">reptiles</span> and <span class="key" about="animal">amphibians</span>), which have historically been <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/warming-threatens-reptiles-more-than-birds-and-mammals/?redirect=1">slower to adapt to climatic change</a> than <span class="key" about="animal">endotherms</span>. For one thing, they are less able to adjust their body temperatures. But there are exceptions, like the <span class="key" about="animal">American bullfrog</span>, which may actually find more habitable environments as a consequence of warming.</p>
					
					<figure class="credits">

						</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>And, of course, there is an alternative: we <span class="key" about="animal">humans</span> could get our acts together and stop the <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> crisis from continuing to snowball by adopting policies and lifestyles that reduce greenhouse gases. But for the purposes of these projections, we’re assuming that’s not going to happen.</p>

					<h2>Tenacious trends</h2>  
					
					<span class="key" about="plant"></span>

					<p>Even with the uncertainties, we can make some educated guesses about broad patterns.</p>

					<p>Heat tolerant and drought resistant <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span>, like those found in deserts rather than rainforests, are more likely to survive. So are <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span> whose seeds can be dispersed over long distances, for instance by wind or ocean currents (like coconuts), rather than by ants (like some acacias). <a href="https://news.iu.edu/stories/2019/05/iub/releases/31-native-plants-climate-change-risk.html"> <span class="key" about="plant">Plants</span> that can adjust their flowering times</a> may also be better able to deal with higher temperatures. <span class="mention person" about="JenLau" data-sort="LauJen" data-label="Jen Lau">Jen Lau</span>, a biologist at <span class="mention organization" about="IndianaUniversityBloomington" data-label="IndianaUniversityBloomington">Indiana University Bloomington</span>
					, suggests that this may give non-native <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span> the advantage when it comes to responding to <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change.</p>

					<p>We also can look to history as a guide. The fossil record contains signs of how species have coped with previous climatic shifts. There are genetic clues to long-term survival too, such as in the <a href="https://news.rutgers.edu/how-some-algae-may-survive-climate-change/20180927#.XOs9f4hKjIV">hardy green microalgae that adapted to saltier environments</a> over millions of years – a finding only made in September 2018 by <span class="mention person" about="FatimaFoflonker" data-sort="FoflonkerFatima" data-label="Fatima Foflonker">Fatima Foflonker</span> of Rutgers and colleagues.</p>
					
					<p>Importantly, though, the uniquely devastating nature of the current human-made <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> crisis means that we can’t fully rely on benchmarks from the past.</p>

					<p>“The <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change that we see in the future will differ in many ways from the <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change that we’ve seen in the past”, notes <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Jamie Carr</span>, an outreach officer for the <span class="mention organization" about="ClimateChangeSpecialistGroup" data-label="Climate Change Specialist Group"> <span class="key" about="climate">Climate</span> Change Specialist Group</span> of the <span class="mention organization" about="IUCNSpeciesSurvivalCommission" data-label="IUCN Species Survival Commission">IUCN Species Survival Commission</span>.</p>

					<p>The historical record does point to the tenacity of <span class="key" about="animal">cockroaches</span>. These largely unloved critters “have survived every mass extinction event in history so far”, says <span class="mention person" about="AsmeretAsefawBerhe" data-sort="BerheAsmeretAsefaw" data-label="Asmeret Asefaw Berhe">Asmeret Asefaw Berhe</span>, a soil biogeochemist at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofCalifornia" data-label="UniversityofCalifornia">University of California</span>, Merced. For instance, <span class="key" about="animal">cockroaches</span> adapted to an increasingly arid <span class="mention place" about="Australia" data-label="Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q881">Australia</span>, tens of millions of years ago, by <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2015.2869">starting to burrow into soil</a>.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>This shows two characteristics, says <span class="mention person" about="RobertNasi" data-sort="NasiRobert" data-label="Robert Nasi">Robert Nasi</span>, the director general of the <span class="mention organization" about="CenterforInternationalForestryResearch(CIFOR)" data-label="Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)">Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)</span>: an “ability to hide and protect in buffered conditions (e.g. underground)” and a long evolutionary history, as in general “ancient species appear more resilient than younger ones”. These are among the traits that, <span class="mention person" about="RobertNasi" data-sort="NasiRobert" data-label="Robert Nasi">Nasi</span> says, are linked to surviving large catastrophic events which triggered major changes in <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span>.</p>

					<p><span class="key" about="animal">Cockroaches</span> also tend to not be picky eaters. Having broad diets means that <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change will be less of a threat to the food sources of species that are not too fussy about their food, such as <span class="key" about="animal">rats</span>, opportunistic <span class="key" about="animal">birds</span>, and urban <span class="key" about="animal">raccoons</span>.</p>

					<p>As a comparison, take an <span class="key" about="animal">animal</span> like the <span class="key" about="animal">koala</span>. <span class="key" about="animal">Koalas</span> eat primarily eucalyptus leaves, which are becoming less nutritious due to increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. As a result, <a href="https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/import/downloads/fact_sheet_red_list_koala_v2.pdf"> <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change is increasing their risk of starvation</a>.</p>

						</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>As well as having a specialised diet, <span class="key" about="animal">koalas</span> have low genetic diversity – one reason that <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-disease-health-koalas-australia/">chlamydia has ravaged wild <span class="key" about="animal">koala</span> populations</a>. These are worrying traits in terms of extinction risk. “In many cases, specialised species are those that we expect to see disappear first,” says <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Carr</span>. This extends to species in microhabitats like high elevation montane forests, or those in narrow ranges, like <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-climate-change-could-affect-some-of-west-africas-iconic-bird-species-117444">some <span class="key" about="animal">tropical birds</span></a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/10/frightening-number-of-plant-extinctions-found-in-global-survey">small-island <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span></a>. Also vulnerable are species that depend on pristine environments.</p>

					<p>That’s compared to the “early successional” species that succeed in disturbed habitats, such as grasslands and young forest. These species “might do well under <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change because they thrive in states of change and transition”, says <span class="mention person" about="JessicaHellmann" data-sort="HellmannJessica" data-label="Jessica Hellmann">Jessica Hellmann</span>, who leads the <span class="mention organization" about="InstituteontheEnvironment" data-label="Institute on the Environment">Institute on the Environment</span> at the <span class="mention organization" about="UniversityofMinnesota" data-label="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</span>. “For example, <span class="key" about="animal">deer</span> (in the <span class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span>) are common in suburban areas and thrive where forests have been removed or are regularly disturbed.”</p>

				<div class="col-4">
					<p>Species that <span class="mention person" about="JamieCarr" data-sort="CarrJamie" data-label="Jamie Carr">Carr</span> calls “mobile generalists”, which can move and adapt to different environments, are likely to be more durable in the face of <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change. While this adaptability is generally positive, it might come at a cost to other parts of an ecosystem. Invasive species like <span class="key" about="animal">cane toads</span>, which are poisonous, have led to local extinctions of other species like <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-indigenous-expertise-improves-science-the-curious-case-of-shy-lizards-and-deadly-cane-toads-113997"> <span class="key" about="animal">quolls</span> (carnivorous <span class="key" about="animal">marsupials</span>) and <span class="key" about="animal">monitors</span> (large <span class="key" about="animal">lizards</span>)</a> in <span class="mention place" about="Australia" data-label="Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q408">Australia</span>. And <span class="mention person" about="JessicaHellmann" data-sort="HellmannJessica" data-label="Jessica Hellmann">Hellmann</span> says that the versatility of invasive plant species “leads to the worry that, in addition to losing vulnerable species, a warmer world will be a weedier world”. The weeds typically found along roadsides may be especially long-lasting in comparison with other <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span>.</p>

					<p>Of course, many organisms are intrinsically less mobile. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236584803_Will_plant_movements_keep_up_with_climate_change">Most <span class="key" about="plant">plants</span> will be unable to move quickly enough</a> to keep pace with <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151228-heres-how-climate-change-will-affect-what-you-eat">rapid heating</a>, although they’ve done so in response to the slower <span class="key" about="climate">climatic</span> changes of the past.</p>

					<h2>Buffer zones</h2>

					<p>The good news is that some specialised species might have a buffer known as <a href="https://www.climaterefugia.org/about-us"><span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change refugia</a>: areas that are relatively protected from <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change’s consequences, such as deep sea canyons. Although deep sea zones are <a href="https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.203/">heating up and declining in oxygen concentrations</a>, <span class="mention person" about="JonathonStillman" data-sort="StillmanJonathon" data-label="Jonathon Stillman">Jonathon Stillman</span>, a marine environmental physiologist at <span class="mention organization" about="SanFranciscoStateUniversity" data-label="San Francisco State University">San Francisco State University</span>, suggests that deep sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems, specifically, might be one bright spot in an otherwise mostly bleak situation.</p>

					<p>“They are pretty much uncoupled from the surface of our planet and I doubt that <span class="key" about="climate">climate</span> change will impact them in the least,” he says. “Humanity didn’t even know they existed until 1977. Their energy comes from the core of our Earth rather than from the Sun, and their already extreme habitat is unlikely to be altered by changes happening at the ocean surface.”</p>

					<p>Similarly,<span class="mention person" about="DouglasSheil" data-sort="SheilDouglas" data-label="Douglas Sheil">Douglas Sheil</span>, a tropical forest ecologist at the <span class="mention organization" about="NorwegianUniversityofLifeSciences" data-label="Norwegian University of Life Sciences">Norwegian University of Life Sciences</span>, suggests that “at some point in the future the only vertebrate species surviving in <span class="mention place" about="Africa" data-label="Africa" data-wikidata-id="Q15">Africa</span> might be a <span class="key" about="animal">blind cave fish</span> deep underground”. As in the deep sea hydrothermal vents, “many species remain undiscovered and thus unknown – <span class="mention place" about="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>’s first <span class="key" about="animal">cave fish</span> was only found in <span class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span> in 2015.”</p>

Indeed, the <span class="key" about="organism">organisms</span> best able to live in severe circumstances are <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/microbes-and-me">microbes</a>, as noted by many of the scientists I’ve surveyed. Computer modelling suggests that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23135934">only <span class="key" about="organism">microbes</span> would be able to survive increasing solar intensity</a>. Soil biogeochemist <span class="mention person" about="AsmeretAsefawBerhe" data-sort="BerheAsmeretAsefaw" data-label="Asmeret Asefaw Berhe">Berhe</span> says of <span class="key" about="organism">archaea</span>, one of the major types of <span class="key" about="organism">microbes</span>, “these critters have figured out how to live in the most extreme of environments”.</p>

					<p>Not quite as tiny but also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05796-x">nearly indestructible</a> are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/27/the-five-tardigrades-tiny-but-tough-subglacial-lake-antarctica-heat-cold-vacuum-space-resilience">tardigrades</a>, commonly known as <span class="key" about="organism">water bears</span>. Environmental physiologist <span class="mention person" about="JonathonStillman" data-sort="StillmanJonathon" data-label="Jonathon Stillman">Stillman</span> enthuses: “They can survive the vacuum of outer space, extreme dehydration, and very high temperatures.

					<p>The future will have not only more extreme environments, but also more urban, human-altered spaces.

Even species that are close to extinction, like <span class="key" about="animal">Saiga antelopes</span>, can be brought back from the brink <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.13112">with enough conservation effort</a>. To reflect the power of sustained conservation, scientists <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2018/03/iucn-green-list-of-species-a-new-way-to-measure-conservation-success/">are developing a Green List</a> of species on the road to recovery and full health, to complement the <span class="mention organization" about="InternationalUnionforConservationofNature" data-label="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</span>’s Red List of threatened species.</p>
