				<p>Scattered amid a relentless barrage of news about COVID-19 case surges, quarantine orders, and medical supply shortages on <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">Twitter</span> this week, some happy stories softened the blows: <span class="mention concept" about="animal" data-sort="animal" data-label="animal">Swans</span> had returned to deserted Venetian canals. <span class="mention concept" about="animal" data-sort="animal" data-label="animal">Dolphins</span> too.

				<p>These reports of wildlife triumphs in countries hard-hit by the novel <span class="mention concept" about="Covid-19" data-sort="Covid-19" data-label="Covid-19">coronavirus</span> got hundreds of thousands of retweets.

				<h2>The pull of posting</h2>

				<p><span class="mention person" about="PauloOrdoveza" data-sort="OrdovezaPaulo" data-label="Paulo Ordoveza">Paulo Ordoveza</span> is a web developer and image verification expert who runs the <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">Twitter</span> account <a href="https://twitter.com/PicPedant">@picpedant</a>, where he debunks fake viral posts‚Äîand calls out the fakers. He sees firsthand the ‚Äúgreed for virality‚Äù that may drive the impulse to propagate misinformation. It‚Äôs ‚Äúoverdosing on the euphoria that comes from seeing those like and retweet numbers rise into the thousands,‚Äù he says.</p>

				<p>Getting a lot of likes and comments ‚Äúgives us an immediate social reward,‚Äù says <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/erin-vogel"><span class="mention person" about="ErinVogel" data-sort="VogelErin" data-label="Erin Vogel">Erin Vogel</span></a>, a social psychologist and postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University. In other words, they make us feel good. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212001409">Studies have found</a> that posting to <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">social media</span> gives one‚Äôs self-esteem a temporary boost.</p>

				<p>The need to seek out things that make us feel good may be exacerbated right now, as people try to come to grips with a <span class="mention concept" about="Covid-19" data-sort="Covid-19" data-label="Covid-19">pandemic</span>, a collapsing economy, and sudden isolation. ‚ÄúIn times when we‚Äôre all really lonely, it‚Äôs tempting to hold onto that feeling, especially if we‚Äôre posting something that gives people a lot of hope,‚Äù says Vogel. The idea that <span class="mention concept" about="animal" data-sort="animal" data-label="animal">animals</span> and nature could actually flourish during this crisis ‚Äúcould help give us a sense of meaning and purpose‚Äîthat we went through this for a reason,‚Äù she says.</p>

				<p>It was the running theme of many of the viral tweets. ‚ÄúNature just hit the reset button on us,‚Äù read a <a href="https://twitter.com/lucadb/status/1239863383354224641?s=20">tweet</a> celebrating the dolphins supposedly swimming in Venetian canals.</p>

				<h5>Despite <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">social media</span> posts claiming otherwise, dolphins are not swimming in <span class="mention place" about="Venice" data-sort="Venice" data-label="Venice">Venice</span>‚Äôs canals.

				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><span class="mention place" about="Venice" data-sort="Venice" data-label="Venice">Venice</span> hasn&#39;t seen clear canal water in a very long time.

				<p>‚ÄúI think people really want to believe in the power of nature to recover,‚Äù says <a href="https://discover.wooster.edu/sclayton/">Susan Clayton</a>, a professor of psychology and environmental studies at the College of Wooster, in Ohio. ‚ÄúPeople hope that, no matter what we‚Äôve done, nature is powerful enough to rise above it.‚Äù (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/great-white-shark-meme-news-photography-animals-peschak">Read about how this incredible‚Äîand real‚Äîshark photo went viral.</a>)</p>

				<p>About half of Americans say they‚Äôve been exposed to made-up news or information related to <span class="mention concept" about="Covid-19" data-sort="Covid-19" data-label="Covid-19">coronavirus</span>, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/03/18/americans-immersed-in-covid-19-news-most-think-media-are-doing-fairly-well-covering-it/">new Pew Research Center survey</a>. While a fake happy news story about dolphins in a canal may not be all that problematic, relatively speaking, there can still be harm in spreading false hope in times of crisis.</p>

				<p>These fake feel-good stories, Vogel says, can make people even more distrustful at a time when everyone already feels vulnerable. Finding out good news isn‚Äôt real ‚Äúcan be even more demoralizing than not hearing it at all.‚Äù</p>

				<p>Spots of hope on <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">social media</span> are likely to play a key role in keeping spirits up in the weeks and months ahead, as people self-quarantine in their homes and connect with each other through screens. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd encourage people to share positive things,‚Äù says Vogel. ‚ÄúBut it doesn‚Äôt have to be anything dramatic. It just has to be true.‚Äù</p>

				<p>SERVE??? Editor‚Äôs note: Want to verify photos online? TinEye and Google offer reverse image searches, which allow you to trace a photo‚Äôs digital footprint. Bellingcat, which does open-sourced fact-checking investigations into human rights abuses and in war zones, also has a thorough guide. If a post seems too good to be true, check <span class="mention concept" about="socialmedia" data-sort="socialmedia" data-label="social media">social media</span> to see if anyone else has already debunked it. This detailed thread, from Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, pinpoints the swan photo to <span class="mention place" about="Burano" data-sort="Burano" data-label="Burano">Burano</span>.</p>
